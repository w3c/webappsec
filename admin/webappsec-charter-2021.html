      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Modern web applications are composed of many parts and
        technologies, creating a complex tapestry of resource and data
        flows between origins. This complexity, as well as the
        historically coarse-grained nature of the security boundaries
        and principals defined for such applications, makes web
        applications very difficult to secure. At the same time,
        securing these applications is ever more critical, as the web
        becomes more and more critical to users' lives.</p>

	<p>This group focuses on the client side of the problem,
	  designing mechanisms user agents can provide to web
	  developers which mitigate the risk of common web attacks,
	  and reduce the surface area that applications expose to
	  attackers. Areas of scope for this working group
	  include:</p>

	<dl>
	  <dt><b>Vulnerability Mitigation</b></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>Sufficiently complex applications involve handling
	    input from untrusted sources in ways that can lead to
	    unexpected code execution, data manipulation, or
	    exfiltration. This Working Group will design mechanisms which reduce
	    the scope, exploitability, and impact of common
	    vulnerabilities and vulnerability classes in web
	    applications (e.g. cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and
	    so on).</p>
	  </dd>

        <dt><b>Attack Surface Reduction</b></dt>

          <dd>
	    <p>The Working Group will design mechanisms which prevent certain
	    categories of threat by reducing the privilege of a given
	    context. This effort will result in tools developers can
	    opt-into which:</p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>Allow applications to restrict or forbid potentially dangerous features which they do not intend to use</li>
	      
	      <li>Govern information and content flows into and out of an application</li>

	      <li>Allow applications to isolate themselves from other origins</li>
	      
	      <li>Reduce the privilege of potentially untrusted content and allow it to be interacted with more safely</li>
		
	      <li>Ensure that application content modification may be detected and prevented</li>
	      
	      <li>Replace or augment error-prone APIs in the browser
	      with safer alternatives (e.g. sanitization, strict
	      contextual autoescaping, validation and encoding
	      requirements, and so on)</li>
	      
	      <li>Enforce requirements on content which loads in a
	      given context (e.g. transport security, embedder/embedee
	      constraints, CORS, etc.)</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>To the extent possible, these restrictions may also be
	      imposed by default to uniformly reduce risk at scale, or
	      may be positioned as prerequisites to some capability or
	      set of capabilities applications may wish to
	      exercise.</p>
          </dd>

	  <dt><b>Manageability</b></dt>
          <dd>
	    <p>
	      Given the ad-hoc nature in which many important security
	    features of the Web have evolved, providing uniformly
	    secure experiences to users is difficult for
	    developers. The Working Group will document and create uniform
	    experiences for several undefined areas of major utility,
	    including:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Providing hinting and direct support for credential
	    managers, whether integrated into the user-agent or
	    3rd-party, to assist users in managing the complexities of
	    secure passwords</li>

	      <li>Application awareness of features which may require
	      explicit user permission to enable.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </dd>
	  
          <dt><b>The Web Security Model</b></dt>
          <dd>
	    <p>The WG may be called on to advise other WGs or the TAG
	    on the fundamental security model of the Web Platform. In
	    doing so, the WG may produce Recommendations for
	    addressing legacy issues with the model (e.g. deprecations
	    and removals), as well as improvements to the baseline it
	    sets (e.g. mitigating cross-origin data leaks or
	    side-channel attacks).</p>
	  </dd>
		<dt><b>WebCrypto</b></dt>
		<dd>The WG may adopt well-supported proposals from incubation for maintenance of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-WebCryptoAPI-20170126/">Web Cryptography API</a>.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>In addition to developing Recommendation Track documents in
	  support of these goals, the Web Application Security Working
	  Group may provide review of specifications from other
	  Working Groups, in particular as these specifications touch
	  on chartered deliverables of this group (in particular CSP),
	  or the Web security model, and may also develop
	  non-normative documents in support of Web security, such as
	  developer and user guides for its normative specifications.</p>

	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	  <p>

          review</a> for accessibility, internationalization,

          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR"
          title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to
          proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major
          changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

          representatives from the key implementors of this

          Leads are expected to contribute one working day per week
          towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement
          for other Participants.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted
        in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>:
        the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face
        meetings will be archived for public review, and technical
        discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner
        that can be both read and written to by the general
        public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications
        will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct
        public contribution requests.  The meetings themselves are not
        open to public participation, however.
        </p>

        <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings,
        teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a href=

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and
          due process, per
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">
          W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor
          or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is
          then refined in discussion with members of the group and
          other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal
          voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and
           consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of
           the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a
           group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational
          deliberation, any resolution (including publication
          decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference
          will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all
          resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or
          web-based survey), with a response period
          from <span id='cfc'>7 to 10 days</span>, depending
          on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the
          issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response
          period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered
          resolved unless and until new information becomes available
          or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the
          Director.
