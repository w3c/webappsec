      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

      <p>Modern Web Applications are composed of many parts and technologies.
        They may transclude, reference or have information flows between
        resources at the same, related or different origins.  Due to the historically
        coarse-grained nature of the security boundaries and principals defined
        for such applications, they can be very difficult to secure.</p>

      <p>In particular, application authors desire uniform policy mechanisms to allow
          application components to drop privileges and reduce the chance they will
          be exploited, or that exploits will compromise other content, to isolate
          themselves from vulnerabilities in content that might otherwise be within the same 
          security boundaries, and to communicate securely across security boundaries. 
          
          These issues are especially relevant for the many web applications
      which incorporate other web application resources (mashups). That is,
      they comprise multiple origins (i.e., security principals).</p>

      <p>Areas of scope for this working group include:</p>

      <dl>

        <dt><b>Attack Surface Reduction</b></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>The WG will design mechanisms to allow applications to:
            <ul>
                <li>Restrict or forbid potentially dangerous features which 
                they do not intend to use</li>
                <li>Govern information and
                    content flows into and out of an application</li>
                <li>Isolate themselves from other content which may contain
                unrelated vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Sandbox potentially untrusted content and allow it to be
                interacted with more safely</li>
                <li>Uniquely identify application content such that unauthorized
                modifications may be detected and prevented</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Secure Mashups</b></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Several mechanisms for secure resource
        sharing and messaging across origins exist or are being specified, but
        several common and desirable use cases are not covered by existing
        work, such as: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Allowing child IFRAMEs to protect themselves from
                    "clickjacking"</li>
                    <li>Providing labeled information flows and confinement
                    propeties to enable secure mashups. This is especially
                    relevent for, e.g. applcations communicating between
                    security principals with
                    different user-granted permissions (e.g. geolocation)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Manageability</b></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Given the ad-hoc nature in which many important security features
                of the Web have evolved, providing uniformly secure experiences
                to users is difficult for developers.  The WG will document
                and create uniform experiences for several undefined areas of 
                major utility, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Treatment of Mixed HTTPS/HTTP Content and defining
                    Secure/Authenticated Origins for purposes of user
                    experience, content inclusion/transclusion and other information flows,
                    and for features which require a verifiably secure
                    environment</li>
                    <li>Providing hinting and direct support for credential
                    managers, whether integrated into the user-agent or 3rd-party,
                    to assist users in managing the complexities of secure
                    passwords</li>
                    <li>Application awareness of features which may
										require explicit user permission to enable.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </dd>

      </dl>

      <p>In addition to developing Recommendation Track documents in support
        of these goals, the Web Application Security Working Group may provide review of
      specifications from other Working Groups, in particular as these
      specifications touch on chartered deliverables of this group (in
      particular CSP), or the Web security model, and may also develop
          non-normative documents in support of Web security, such as
          developer and user guides for its normative specifications.</p>      
      
      <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
    
      <p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected
      to have two independent implementations of each feature described in the
      specification.</p>      

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
      
      <p>All of the following deliverables are on or proposed for the Recommendation Track:</p>

      <dl>

        <dt><b>
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/">Content Security Policy Level 2</a> (CR)<br>
          Content Security Policy "Next" (ED)</b>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A policy language intended to enable web designers or server
          administrators to declare a security policy for a web resource.
          The goal of this specification is to reduce attack surface by
          specifying overall rules for what content may or may not do, thus
          preventing violation of security assumptions by attackers who are
          able to partially manipulate that content.  Content Security Policy
          (CSP) Level 2 succeeds CSP 1.0, which will transition to WG Note
          status, and the WG will begin work on additional features while
          Level 2 advances from Candidate to full Recommendation.</p>
        </dd>

				
        <dt><b>Content Security Policy Pinning</b></dt>

        <dd> 
					<p>
					Define a new HTTP header that allows authors to instruct user 
					agents to remember ("pin") and enforce a Content Security Policy 
					for a set of hosts for a period of time.
					</p>
        </dd>


        <dt><b><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UISecurity/">User Interface Security 
            Directives for Content Security Policy</a> (LCWD)</b></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Create and advance existing recommendations specifying bi-
          directional parent/child policies to enable secure mash-up
          applications built around cross-domain framing. To express necessary
          constraints and demands, this deliverable will re-use and extend the
          policy language of the Content Security Policy deliverable with the
          goal of creating uniform semantics for requirements currently
          disjoint in expression and implementation across the CSP, the HTML5
          IFRAME sandbox, and the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. This work will
          be closely coordinated with the IETF websec WG in order to avoid 
          overlapping or conflicting specifications.</p>
        </dd>
    
        <dt>
          <b><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/">Mixed Content</a> (LCWD)</b>
        </dt>

        <dd> <p>A recommendation for dealing with
          resources loaded over insecure channels in a secure web application.
          Use cases includes standard behaviors for user agents to follow when encountering
            insecure resource loads in a secure context.  This might include
            definitions of “active” and “passive” content that must be blocked
            or can be loaded with a warning, and possibly ways for secure
            applications to consume insecure but non-sensitive resources (such
            as a weather feed).
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Upgrade Insecure Requests</b></dt>

        <dd> 
					<p>
					 Create a mechanism to assist in sites migrating from HTTP to HTTPS by allowing them 
					 to assert to a user agent that they intend a site to load only secure resources, 
					 and that insecure URLs ought to be treated as though they had been replaced with secure URLs.
					 This functionality will be delivered either as a standalone recommendation, or as part of
					 an update to the Mixed Content deliverable.
					</p>
        </dd>


				<dt>
          <b><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/powerful-features/">Privileged Contexts</a> (FPWD)</b>
        </dt>

        <dd> <p>A recommendation for dealing with features which self-designate as requiring
		a privileged context to be enabled, e.g. because such features provide
		access to sensitive personal information.  The recommendation will include non-normative
		advice on when a feature might designate itself as requiring a secure context and provide
		a normative algorithm for determining if a given context is privileged.
		This work will be a joint deliverable with the W3C Technical Architecture Group.
	    </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/">Subresource Integrity</a> (FPWD)</b>
        </dt>

        <dd> <p>A recommendation for uniquely identifying 
          resources loaded in a secure web application to detect and prevent
            potentially malicious modification.
          Use cases include adding integrity protections to sub-resource loads from HTML
            documents. This mechanism would have the goals of allowing
            resource authors to specify the exact hash value of cross-
            origin sub-resources. Possible future features may include
            allowing optimistic loading of such resources from content-
            aware caches or over insecure transports, provided appropriate
            privacy and security guarantees can be achieved.
            This work would be coordinated with and possibly be a joint
            deliverable with the HTML WG.

        </dd>
        
        <dt>
          <b><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/">Referrer Policy</a> (FPWD)</b>
        </dt>

        <dd> <p>A recommendation for a header and meta tag allowing resource authors to specify
            a policy for the values sent as part of the HTTP Referer (sic) header.  Use cases
            include making this policy more restrictive to protect applications which include
            security capability tokens in the URL, or allowing more permissive sharing of 
            referrer information from secure to insecure origins to remove barriers which today
            prevent applications from moving to secure origins.</p>
        </dd>        

        <dt><b>Credential Management API</b></dt>

        <dd> 
          <p>Create and advance recommendation(s) for a standardized API to address use cases
              related to assisted management of user credentials, including traditional
              username/password pairs, username/federated identity provider pairs.  The API
              should allow for explicit and interoperable imperative mechanism for use and 
              lifecycle management of these common credential types.</p> 
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Suborigin Namespaces</b></dt>

        <dd> 
          <p>Create and advance a recommendation to allow applications to place themselves
              into namespaces within a traditional scheme/host/port RFC 6454 Origin label to enable
              easier development of modular applications with privilege separation.</p> 
        </dd>
        
        <dt><b>Confinement with Origin Web Labels</b></dt>

        <dd> 
		<p>Create and advance a recommendation for a robust JavaScript confinement
		system for modern web browsers, in a way that is backward-compatible
		with legacy web content.  The goal of the specification is to define APIs for
		specifying privacy and integrity policies on data, in the form of origin
		labels, and a mechanism for confining browsing contexts (pages, iframes,
		etc.) according to these labels. This would allow Web application authors
		and server operators to share data with untrusted -- buggy but not malicious --
		code (e.g., in a mashup scenario, cross-origin iframes) yet impose restrictions on how
		the code can further share the sensitive data.</p>

		<p>An additional goal is to define a light-weight, in-thread Web Worker.
		This would allow developers to build privilege-separated,
		compartmentalized applications</p>
        </dd>

        <!--
        <dt><b>Lightweight Isolated / Safe Content</b></dt>

        <dd> 
          <p>Create and advance recommendation(s) for lightweight isolation
          and safety mechanisms for composed web applications. An iframe used with
          postMessage can provide a strong isolation barrier, but, for some scenarios, requires
          too many resources on the client and presents an unfriendly API to
          developers.  The deliverable(s) will describe
          mechanisms to compose applications from imported components while
          isolating the application from malicious impacts of those
          components in a backwards-compatible manner.</p> 
        </dd>
        -->

        <dt><b>Entry Point Regulation for Web Applications</b></dt>

        <dd> 
          <p>Create and advance a recommendation to allow web applications to 
            designate their entry points via a combination of headers and a policy
            manifest.  Conformant user agents will restrict external navigations
            and other information flows into the application based on this policy to reduce the
            application's attack surface against Cross-Site Scripting and Cross
            Site Request Forgery.
            </p> 
						<p>Restricting deep-linking for non-security purposes is not a goal of
						this deliverable, and it should give resource owners no additional ability to
						do so beyond current abilities of the web platform, e.g. by providing a 
						simple to deploy mechanism using client-side state to supplement what can
						already be accomplished by a less-scalable web application firewall.
						Preserving the ability to link on the web platform will be prioritized.
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Permissions API</b></dt>

        <dd> 
          <p>Create and advance a recommendation to allow web applications to 
						be aware of the status of a given permission, to know whether it is granted,
						denied, or if the user will be asked whether the permission should be granted.
						This recommendation will not address user agent implementations of permissions,
          	including their scope, duration, granularity, or user interface and
          	experience for indicating, configuring, or asking for permissions.</p>

      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

      

      <p>To be successful, the Web Application Security Working Group is
      expected to have 10 active participants for its duration. Effective
      participation to Web Application Security Working Group is expected to
      consume one day per week for chairs and editors. The Web Application
      Security Working Group will allocate also the necessary resources for
      building Test Suites for each specification.</p>

    <div class="communication">
      <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

      
  <p>This group primarily conducts its work on the public
  mailing list public-webappsec@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/">archive</a>).
  </p>
      
      
      

      <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants,
      face-to-face
      meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is
      available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web Application Security Working Group home

      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus" shape="rect">section
      3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there
      is consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes
      dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, 
			the Chairs should put a question out for voting within 
			the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation 
			-- using, for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques)
			and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter 
			should then be considered resolved unless and until new information
			becomes available.</p>
			
			<p>Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or
			teleconference [i.e., that does not follow a 7 day call for consensus on the
			mailing list] is to be considered provisional until 5 working days
			after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes, available
			from the WG's calendar or home page. 
			If no objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, 
			the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution 
			of the Working Group.</p>
