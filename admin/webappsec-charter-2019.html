      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

      <p>Modern Web Applications are composed of many parts and technologies. They may transclude,
      reference or have information flows between resources at the same, related or different
      origins. Due to the historically coarse-grained nature of the security boundaries and
      principals defined for such applications, they can be very difficult to secure.</p>

      <p>In particular, application authors desire uniform policy mechanisms to allow application
      components to drop privileges and reduce the chance they will be exploited, or that exploits
      will compromise other content, to isolate themselves from vulnerabilities in content that
      might otherwise be within the same security boundaries, and to communicate securely across
      security boundaries. These issues are especially relevant for the many web applications which
      incorporate other web application resources (mashups). That is, they comprise multiple
      origins (i.e., security principals).</p>

      <p>Areas of scope for this working group include:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><b>Vulnerability Mitigation</b></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Vulnerabilities are inevitable in sufficiently complex applications. The WG will work
          on mechanisms to reduce the scope, exploitability and impact of common vulnerabilites and
          vulnerability classes in web applications, especially script injection / XSS.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Attack Surface Reduction</b></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The WG will design mechanisms to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Allow applications to restrict or forbid potentially dangerous features which they
            do not intend to use</li>

            <li>Govern information and content flows into and out of an application</li>

            <li>Allow applications to isolate themselves from other content which may contain
            unrelated vulnerabilities</li>

            <li>Sandbox potentially untrusted content and allow it to be interacted with more
            safely</li>

            <li>Uniquely identify application content such that unauthorized modifications may be
            detected and prevented</li>

            <li>Replace or augment injection-prone APIs in the browser with safer alternatives
            using strategies such as sanitization, strict contextual autoescaping, and other
            validation and encoding strategies currently employed by server-side code.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Secure Mashups</b></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Several mechanisms for secure resource sharing and messaging across origins exist or
          are being specified, but several common and desirable use cases are not covered by
          existing work, such as:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Allowing child IFRAMEs to protect themselves from "clickjacking"</li>

            <li>Providing labeled information flows and confinement properties to enable secure
            mashups. This is especially relevant for, e.g. applications communicating between
            security principals with different user-granted permissions (e.g. geolocation)</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Manageability</b></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Given the ad-hoc nature in which many important security features of the Web have
          evolved, providing uniformly secure experiences to users is difficult for developers. The
          WG will document and create uniform experiences for several undefined areas of major
          utility, including:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Treatment of Mixed HTTPS/HTTP Content and defining Secure/Authenticated Origins for
            purposes of user experience, content inclusion/transclusion and other information
            flows, and for features which require a verifiably secure environment</li>

            <li>Providing hinting and direct support for credential managers, whether integrated
            into the user-agent or 3rd-party, to assist users in managing the complexities of
            secure passwords</li>

            <li>Application awareness of features which may require explicit user permission to
            enable.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>The Web Security Model</b></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The WG may be called on to advise other WGs or the TAG on the fundamental security
          model of the Web Platform and may produce Recommendations towards the advancement of, or
          addressing legacy issues with, the model, such as mitigating cross-origin data leaks or
          side channel attacks.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>In addition to developing Recommendation Track documents in support of these goals, the
      Web Application Security Working Group may provide review of specifications from other
      Working Groups, in particular as these specifications touch on chartered deliverables of this
      group (in particular CSP), or the Web security model, and may also develop non-normative
      documents in support of Web security, such as developer and user guides for its normative
      specifications.</p>

      <h3>Success Criteria</h3>

      <p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected to have two
      independent implementations of each feature described in the specification.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

      <p>All of the following deliverables are on or proposed for the Recommendation Track:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt id="csp3" class="spec"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/">Content Security Policy
        Level 3</a></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A policy language intended to enable web designers or server administrators to declare
          a security policy for a web resource. The goal of this specification is to reduce attack
          surface by specifying overall rules for what content may or may not do, thus preventing
          violation of security assumptions by attackers who are able to partially manipulate that
          content. Content Security Policy (CSP) Level 3 succeeds CSP2, which is now a Recommendation.</p>

        <dt class="spec"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/csp-embedded-enforcement/">Content Security
        Policy: Embedded Enforcement</a></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Define a mechanism by which a web page can embed a nested browsing context if and only
          if it agrees to enforce a particular set of restrictions upon itself.</p>

        Security and the Visibility API</a></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Create and advance existing recommendations specifying bi- directional parent/child
          policies to enable secure mash-up applications built around cross-domain framing. To
          express necessary constraints and demands, this deliverable will re-use and extend the
          policy language of the Content Security Policy deliverable with the goal of creating
          uniform semantics for requirements currently disjoint in expression and implementation
          across the CSP, the HTML5 IFRAME sandbox, and the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. This work
          will be closely coordinated with IETF in order to avoid overlapping or
          conflicting specifications.</p>

          <p>A recommendation defining "secure contexts", thereby allowing user agent implementers
          and specification authors to enable certain features only when certain minimum standards
          of authentication and confidentiality are met.</p>

        <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/">Referrer Policy</a></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A recommendation for a header and meta tag allowing resource authors to specify a
          policy for the values sent as part of the HTTP Referer (sic) header. Use cases include
          making this policy more restrictive to protect applications which include security
          capability tokens in the URL, or allowing more permissive sharing of referrer information
          from secure to insecure origins to remove barriers which today prevent applications from
          moving to secure origins.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>Create and advance a recommendation for a robust JavaScript confinement system for
          modern web browsers, in a way that is backward-compatible with legacy web content. The
          goal of the specification is to define APIs for specifying privacy and integrity policies
          on data, in the form of origin labels, and a mechanism for confining browsing contexts
          (pages, iframes, etc.) according to these labels. This would allow Web application
          authors and server operators to share data with untrusted code (e.g., in a mashup
          scenario, cross-origin iframes) yet impose restrictions on how the code can further share
          the sensitive data.</p>

          <p>An additional goal is to define a light-weight, in-thread Web Worker. This would allow
          developers to build privilege-separated, compartmentalized applications, in addition to
          sandboxing potentially untrusted scripts.</p>

          <p>Create and advance a recommendation to allow web applications to be aware of the
          status of a given permission, to know whether it is granted, denied, or if the user will
          be asked whether the permission should be granted. This recommendation will not address

        <p>To be successful, the Web Application Security Working Group is expected to have 10
        active participants for its duration. Effective participation to Web Application Security
        Working Group is expected to consume one day per week for chairs and editors. The Web
        Application Security Working Group will allocate also the necessary resources for building
        Test Suites for each specification.</p>

      <div class="communication">
        <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

        <p>This group conducts general discussion on the public mailing list
        public-webappsec@w3.org (<a href=
        "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/">archive</a>).</p>

        <p>Discussion on issues related to specific deliverables is primarily conducted
        through the use of GitHub issues.  The WG's main GitHub repository is at
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webappsec">https://github.com/w3c/webappsec</a>,
        which links to individual repositories for each deliverable.</p>

        <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings,
        teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web Application Security Working Group home
        page</a>.</p>

      <div class="decisions">
        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus"
        shape="rect">section 3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
        consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after due consideration of
        different opinions, the Chairs should put a question out for voting within the group
        (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email and/or
        web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter
        should then be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.</p>

        <p>Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference [i.e., that does
        not follow a 7 day call for consensus on the mailing list] is to be considered provisional
        until 5 working days after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes, available
        from the WG's calendar or home page. If no objections are raised on the mailing list within
        that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the
        Working Group.</p>
