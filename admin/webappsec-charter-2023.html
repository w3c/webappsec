        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p><i class="todo">Background of landscape, technology, and relationship to the Web, users, developers, implementers, and industry.</i></p>
      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Modern web applications are composed of many parts and
          technologies, creating a complex tapestry of resource and data
          flows between origins. This complexity, as well as the
          historically coarse-grained nature of the security boundaries
          and principals defined for such applications, makes web
          applications very difficult to secure. At the same time,
          securing these applications is ever more critical, as the web
          becomes more and more critical to users' lives.</p>
  
    <p>This group focuses on the client side of the problem,
      designing mechanisms user agents can provide to web
      developers which mitigate the risk of common web attacks,
      and reduce the surface area that applications expose to
      attackers. Areas of scope for this working group
      include:</p>
  
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Vulnerability Mitigation</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Sufficiently complex applications involve handling
        input from untrusted sources in ways that can lead to
        unexpected code execution, data manipulation, or
        exfiltration. This Working Group will design mechanisms which reduce
        the scope, exploitability, and impact of common
        vulnerabilities and vulnerability classes in web
        applications (e.g. cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and
        so on).</p>
      </dd>
  
          <dt><b>Attack Surface Reduction</b></dt>
  
            <dd>
        <p>The Working Group will design mechanisms which prevent certain
        categories of threat by reducing the privilege of a given
        context. This effort will result in tools developers can
        opt-into which:</p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>Allow applications to restrict or forbid potentially dangerous features which they do not intend to use</li>
          
          <li>Govern information and content flows into and out of an application</li>
  
          <li>Allow applications to isolate themselves from other origins</li>
          
          <li>Reduce the privilege of potentially untrusted content and allow it to be interacted with more safely</li>
      
          <li>Ensure that application content modification may be detected and prevented</li>
          
          <li>Replace or augment error-prone APIs in the browser
          with safer alternatives (e.g. sanitization, strict
          contextual autoescaping, validation and encoding
          requirements, and so on)</li>
          
          <li>Enforce requirements on content which loads in a
          given context (e.g. transport security, embedder/embedee
          constraints, CORS, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To the extent possible, these restrictions may also be
          imposed by default to uniformly reduce risk at scale, or
          may be positioned as prerequisites to some capability or
          set of capabilities applications may wish to
          exercise.</p>
            </dd>
  
      <dt><b>Manageability</b></dt>
            <dd>
        <p>
          Given the ad-hoc nature in which many important security
        features of the Web have evolved, providing uniformly
        secure experiences to users is difficult for
        developers. The Working Group will document and create uniform
        experiences for several areas of major utility,
        including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Providing hinting and direct support for credential
        managers, whether integrated into the user-agent or
        3rd-party, to assist users in managing the complexities of
        secure passwords</li>
  
          <li>Application awareness of features which may require
          explicit user permission to enable.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      
            <dt><b>The Web Security Model</b></dt>
            <dd>
        <p>The WG may be called on to advise other WGs or the TAG
        on the fundamental security model of the Web Platform. In
        doing so, the WG may produce Recommendations for
        addressing legacy issues with the model (e.g. deprecations
        and removals), as well as improvements to the baseline it
        sets (e.g. mitigating cross-origin data leaks or
        side-channel attacks).</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>WebCrypto</b></dt>
      <dd>The WG may adopt well-supported proposals from incubation for maintenance of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-WebCryptoAPI-20170126/">Web Cryptography API</a>.</dd>
    </dl>
  
    <p>In addition to developing Recommendation Track documents in
      support of these goals, the Web Application Security Working
      Group may provide review of specifications from other
      Working Groups, in particular as these specifications touch
      on chartered deliverables of this group (in particular CSP),
      or the Web security model, and may also develop
      non-normative documents in support of Web security, such as
      developer and user guides for its normative specifications.</p>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
    <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">Candidate Recommendation</a> and to add features after reaching Candidate Recommendation, each feature is expected to be supported by at least two implementations, which may be judged by factors including existing implementations, expressions of interest, and lack of opposition. </p>

	  <p>
      In order to advance to 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p>
      To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications 
      in Candidate Recommendation 
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.  
      Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

	  <p>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.

          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of

          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>7 to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
