### Draft Agenda

*   CSP Triage updates (@ciaramcmullin, et al): It sounds like there are some specific issues which would benefit from wider discussion.
*   [Signature-based Integrity](https://wicg.github.io/signature-based-sri/) updates (@mikewest)
    *   In particular, forward-compat concerns in WICG/signature-based-sri#38.  
*   [`Timing-Allow-Origin` guidelines](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/issues/664)?
*   CSP script-src [`trusted-types-eval`](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/pull/665) keyword addition.
