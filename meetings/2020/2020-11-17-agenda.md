### Agenda

* Site-Isolation
	* A look at the status and plans for Site-Isolation, especially in browsers other than Chrome.
* Future path for Web Application Security WG
	* our charter will need to be renewed by March. This is a perfect time to consider the state of web application security
	* What are the biggest threats to web application security?
	* What standards efforts could help selve those problems?
* [CORS-RFC1918](https://wicg.github.io/cors-rfc1918/)
  * Rescheduled from September if Titouan Rigoudy is available: a walk through the WICG proposal and some of the work they're doing in Chromium. Roadblocks to deployment in the real world web.
* [Document Policy](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html)
  * Should this spec, currently living in the [Permissions Policy](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy) repo, be chartered by this group? Should it move into incubation? Or is its future somewhere else?
