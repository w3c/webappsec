## Agenda
https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2022Aug/0002.html

## Brainstorming

XSLeaks
-------
* cross-site leaks (XSLeaks) (Giorgio requests Europe-friendly time)

Injection Stuff
---------------
* related to XSLeaks: CSP directives that cause leaks (e.g. form-action)
* related to the above: CSP as confinement; what's missing, what could make this a robust defense?
* CSP: webrtc controls
* CSP: WASM source control rather than just on/off?
* Updates on the deployments of injection defenses & isolation features (CSP, TT, Fetch Metadata, COOP)
* Sanitizer & Trusted Types

ISOLATION
---------
* "Isolation by default"
* site isolation
* New features related to cross-origin isolation: COOP restrict-properties, anonymous iframes, COEP credentialless. (Giorgio requests Europe-friendly time)

Permissions
-----------
* status of Permission Policy/Registry/API
* Permissions Workshop

Partitioning
------------
* storage partitioning   (privacy/performance/security tradeoffs)
**  network state / cache partitioning designs/experiments
* Can we finally kill^Wpartition :visited? kthx

Ads and Stuff 
-------------
* Private Advertising work (in CGs, potential WG), security considerations or features that belong here
** fenced frames (wicg)
** private ad attribution (PATCG)
** privacy vs anti-fraud tradeoffs
* Cookies
(Improving Web Ads BG meets Tuesday morning in the same slot)

Web Crypto stuff (now included in this WG's charter)
----------------
* [Curve25519 and Curve448](https://wicg.github.io/webcrypto-secure-curves/)
* Other more modern algorithms (OCB,   Argon2, SHA-3, ...)
* Feature detection (of those algorithms)?
* Streaming

(Daniel Huigens: ~I might be in Europe, not 100% sure yet whether I can attend in person~ I will be attending in person :))

Process + WG + Other
--------------------
* spec issues that need decisions
* Meeting times.

New Stuff
---------
* [arcsjs](https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/doc/explainer) and the related [WICG proposal](https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/62)
* Exposing "public static resource" metadata: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/8143 (the role of CORP & TAO)

(Small proposal: maybe merge XS-Leaks & Isolation sections? Similarly Partitioning could be under Ads + Stuff.)

## Minutes 

MikeWest: TPAC. We have three scheduled slots (one YVR morning, Europe-friendly; two YVR afternoon, potentially Asia-Pacific friendly). Let's think about what we can usefully discuss there.
Things this group is responsible for; things tangentially related where we might have opinions and input (e.g. HTML and Fetch inputs). Dan put out a set of suggestions, brainstorming: [as pasted in "brainstorming" above ^] Please make more suggestions in the doc above. 

Dan: We'd like to arrange to cover as much as possible Tuesday morning, the slot with best TZ European overlap.
