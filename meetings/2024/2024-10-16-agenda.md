### Draft Agenda

*   CSP Issue Triage: We [discussed CSP maintenance](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/blob/main/meetings/2024/2024-09-26-TPAC-minutes.md#csp-maintenance) (briefly) at TPAC, and there are a few folks interested in helping out. Let's talk a bit about the goals and how we might organize the work.

*   Integrity: Following on our [Integrity on the Web](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/blob/main/meetings/2024/2024-09-23-TPAC-Minutes.md#application-integrity) discussion, there's interest in reviving the [Signature-based SRI](https://github.com/WICG/signature-based-sri) proposal. There's a [draft spec](https://wicg.github.io/signature-based-sri/) and ongoing discussion in GitHub issues that might be worth following up on together.

*   [Realms-Initialization-Control](https://github.com/WICG/Realms-Initialization-Control): @weizman suggested a followup to [our TPAC discussion](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/blob/main/meetings/2024/2024-09-26-TPAC-minutes.md#realms-initialization-control) to get more feedback on the proposal and dig into [inheritance](https://github.com/WICG/Realms-Initialization-Control/issues/10) specifically.
