      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This document defines Content Security Policy, a mechanism web
      applications can use to mitigate a broad class of content injection
      vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). Content Security
      Policy is a declarative policy that lets the authors (or server
      administrators) of a web application inform the client about the sources
      from which the application expects to load resources.</p>

      <p>To mitigate XSS attacks, for example, a web application can declare
      that it only expects to load script from specific, trusted sources. This
      declaration allows the client to detect and block malicious scripts
      injected into the application by an attacker.</p>

      <p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is not intended as a first line of
      defense against content injection vulnerabilities. Instead, CSP is best
      used as defense-in-depth, to reduce the harm caused by content injection
      attacks. As a first line of defense against content injection, server
      operators should validate their input and encode their output.</p>

      <p>There is often a non-trivial amount of work required to apply CSP to
      an existing web application. To reap the greatest benefit, authors will
      need to move all inline script and style out-of-line, for example into
      external scripts, because the user agent cannot determine whether an
      inline script was injected by an attacker.</p>

      <p>To take advantage of CSP, a web application opts into using CSP by
      supplying a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> HTTP header. Such
      policies apply to the current resource representation only. To supply a
      policy for an entire site, the server needs to supply a policy with each
      resource representation.</p>

      <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
      "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
      steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("MUST",
      "SHOULD", "MAY", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>

      <p>A <dfn>conformant user agent</dfn> MUST implement all the
      requirements listed in this specification that are applicable to

        <h3>Key Concepts and Terminology</h3>

        <p>This section defines several terms used throughout the document.</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>security policy</dfn>, or simply <dfn>policy</dfn>, for
        the purposes of this specification refers to either:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>a set of security preferences for restrictions within which the
          content can operate, or</li>
          <li>a fragment of text that codifies these preferences.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The security policies defined by this document are applied by a
        user agent on a <em>per-resource representation basis</em>.
        Specifically, when a user agent receives a policy along with the
        representation of a given resource, that policy applies to <em>that
        resource representation only</em>. This document often refers to
        that resource representation as the <dfn>protected resource</dfn>.

        <p>A server transmits its security policy for a particular protected
        resource as a collection of <dfn>directives</dfn>, such as
        <code>default-src 'self'</code>, each of which declares a specific set
        of restrictions for that resource as instantiated by the user agent.
        More details are provided in the <a href="#directives">directives</a>
        section.</p>

        <p>A directive consists of a <dfn>directive name</dfn>, which
        indicates the privileges controlled by the directive, and a
        <dfn>directive value</dfn>, which specifies the restrictions the
        policy imposes on those privileges.</p>

        <p>The term <dfn id="origin">origin</dfn> is defined in the Origin specification. [[!RFC6454]]</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>globally unique identifier</dfn> is defined in section 4 of the Origin specification. Note that URLs that do not use hierarchical elements as naming authorities have origins which are globally unique identifiers. [[!RFC6454]]</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>URI</dfn> is defined in the URI specification.  [[!URI]]</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>resource representation</dfn> is defined in the HTTP 1.1 specification.  [[!HTTP11]]</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>JSON object</dfn> is defined in the JSON specification.  [[!RFC4627]]</p>

        <p>The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;track&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>
        and <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements are defined in the HTML5 specification. [[!HTML5]]</p>

        <p>The terms <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#auxiliary-browsing-context"><dfn>auxiliary browsing context</dfn></a>,
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#opener-browsing-context"><dfn>opener browsing context</dfn></a>,
        and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#nested-browsing-context"><dfn>nested browsing context</dfn></a>
        are defined in the HTML5 specification. [[!HTML5]]</p>

        <p>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#plugin">plugin</a> is defined
        in the HTML5 specification. [[!HTML5]]</p>

        <p>The <code>@font-face</code> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rule is defined in the
        CSS Fonts Module Level 3 specification. [[!css-fonts-3]]</p>

        <p>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is defined in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>
        specification. [[!XMLHttpRequest]]</p>

        <p>The <code>WebSocket</code> object is defined in the <code>WebSocket</code>
        specification. [[!websockets]]</p>

        <p>The <code>EventSource</code> object is defined in the <code>EventSource</code>
        specification. [[!eventsource]]</p>

        <p>The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation used in this
        document is specified in RFC 5234. [[!ABNF]]</p>

        <p>This document also uses the ABNF extension "#rule" as defined in HTTP 1.1. [[!HTTP11]]</p>

        <p>The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
        [<em><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1">ABNF Appendix B.1</a></em>]:
        <code>ALPHA</code> (letters), <code>DIGIT</code> (decimal
        0-9), <code>WSP</code> (white space) and <code>VCHAR</code> (printing
        characters).</p>

      <h2>Framework</h2>

      <p>This section defines the general framework for content security
      policies, including the delivery mechanisms and general syntax for
      policies. The next section contains the details of the specific
      directives introduced in this specification.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Policy Delivery</h3>

        <p>The server delivers the policy to the user agent via an HTTP
        response header.</p>

        <section>
          <h4><code>Content-Security-Policy</code> Header Field</h4>

          <p>The <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header field is the
          preferred mechanism for delivering a policy.</p>

<pre>
"Content-Security-Policy:" 1#policy
</pre>

          <p>A server MAY send more than one HTTP header field named
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> with a given resource
          representation.</p>

          <p>A server MAY send different <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
          header field values with different representations of the same
          resource or with different resources.</p>

          <p>Upon receiving an HTTP response containing at least one
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header field, the user agent
          MUST <a href="#enforce">enforce</a> each of the policies contained
          in each such header field.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4><code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> Header Field</h4>

          <p>The <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header field
          lets servers experiment with policies by monitoring (rather than
          enforcing) a policy.</p>

<pre>
"Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only:" 1#policy
</pre>

          <p>For example, a server operators might wish to develop their
          security policy iteratively. The operators can deploy a report-only
          policy based on their best estimate of how their site behaves. If
          their site violates this policy, instead of breaking the site, the
          user agent will
          <a href="#dfn-send-violation-reports">send violation reports</a> to
          a URI specified in the policy. Once a site has confidence that the
          policy is appropriate, they start enforcing the policy using the
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header field.</p>

          <p>A server MAY send more than one HTTP header field named
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> with a given
          resource representation.</p>

          <p>A server MAY send different
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header field values
          with different representations of the same resource or with different
          resources.</p>

          <p>Upon receiving an HTTP response containing at least one
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header field, the
          user agent MUST <a href="#monitor">monitor</a> each of the policies
          contained in each such header field.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>HTML <code>meta</code> Element</h4>

          <p>The server MAY supply a policy in an HTML <code>meta</code>
          element with an <code>http-equiv</code> attribute that is a case
          insensitive match for <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>.</p>

          <p>Add the following entry to the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#pragma-directives">pragma
          directives</a> for the <code>meta</code> element:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Content security policy (<code>http-equiv="content-security-policy"</code>)</dt>
            <dd>
              <ol>
                <li>If the user agent is already enforcing a policy for the
                document, abort these steps.</li>

                <li>If the Document's <code>head</code> element is not an
                ancestor of the <code>meta</code> element, abort these
                steps.</li>

                <li>If the <code>meta</code> element lacks a
                <code>content</code> attribute, abort these steps.</li>

                <li>Let <var>policy</var> be the value of the
                <code>content</code> attribute of the <code>meta</code>
                element.</li>

                <li>Let <var>directive-set</var> be the result of
                <a href="#parse-a-policy">parsing <var>policy</var></a>.</li>

                <li>Remove all occurances of <code>report-uri</code> and
                <code>sandbox</code> directives from <var>directive-set</var>.</li>

                <li>Enforce each of the directives in <var>directive-set</var>,
                as <a href="#sec-directives">defined for each directive type</a>.</li>
              </ol>
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>As a consequence of these requirements, a policy supplied in an
          HTTP header field takes precedence over policies supplied in
          <code>meta</code> elements. Similarly, the above requirements entail
          that the first <code>meta</code> element containing a policy takes
          precedence over policies supplied in subsequent <code>meta</code>
          elements, and that modifications to the <code>content</code>
          attribute after it is parsed will be ignored.. Authors SHOULD place
          the <code>meta</code> element as early in the document as possible
          to reduce the risk of content injection before a protective policy
          can be read and enforced.</p>
          
          <p>Note that the <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code>
          header is <em>not</em> supported inside a <code>meta</code>
          element.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Enforcing multiple policies.</h4>
          <p>The above sections note that when multiple policies are present,
          each must be enforced or reported, according to its type. An example
          will help clarify how that ought to work in practice. The behavior of
          an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> might seem unclear given a site
          that, for whatever reason, delivered the following HTTP headers:</p>
          <pre>
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' http://example.com http://example.net;
                         connect-src 'none';
Content-Security-Policy: connect-src http://example.com/;
                         script-src http://example.com/
          </pre>
          <p>Is a connection to <code>example.com</code> allowed or not? The
          short answer is that the connection is not allowed. Enforcing both
          policies means that a potential connection would have to pass through
          both unscathed. Even though the second policy would allow this
          connection, the first policy contains <code>connect-src 'none'</code>,
          so its enforcement blocks the connection. The impact is that adding
          additional policies to the list of policies to enforce can only
          further restrict the capabilities of the protected resource.</p>
          <p>To demonstrate that further, consider a script tag on this page.
          The first policy would lock scripts down to <code>'self'</code>,
          <code>http://example.com</code> and <code>http://example.net</code>
          via the <code>default-src</code> directive. The second, however, would
          only allow script from <code>http://example.com/</code>. Script will
          only load if it meets both policy's criteria: in this case, the only
          origin that can match is <code>http://example.com</code>, as both
          policies allow it.</p>

          <h4>Policies</h4>

          <p>A Content Security Policy consists of a U+003B SEMICOLON

          <h4>Source List</h4>

          <p>Many CSP directives use a value consisting of a <dfn>source
          list</dfn>.</p>

          <p>Each <dfn>source expression</dfn> in the source list represents a
          location from which content of the specified type can be retrieved.
          For example, the source expression <code>'self'</code> represents
          the set of URIs which are in the same <a href="#origin">origin</a> as the protected
          resource and the source expression <code>'unsafe-inline'</code>
          represents content supplied inline in the resource itself.</p>

<pre>
source-list       = *WSP [ source-expression *( 1*WSP source-expression ) *WSP ]
                  / *WSP "'none'" *WSP
source-expression = scheme-source / host-source / keyword-source / nonce-source / hash-source
scheme-source     = scheme ":"
host-source       = [ scheme "://" ] host [ port ] [ path ]
keyword-source    = "'self'" / "'unsafe-inline'" / "'unsafe-eval'"
base64-value      = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/" )*2( "=" )
nonce-value       = base64-value
hash-value        = base64-value
nonce-source      = "'nonce-" nonce-value "'"
hash-algo         = "sha256" / "sha384" / "sha512"
hash-source       = "'" hash-algo "-" base64-value "'"
scheme            = &lt;scheme production from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.1">RFC 3986, section 3.1</a>&gt;
host              = "*" / [ "*." ] 1*host-char *( "." 1*host-char )
host-char         = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-"
path              = &lt;path production from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3">RFC 3986, section 3.3</a>&gt;
port              = ":" ( 1*DIGIT / "*" )

          <p>If the policy contains a <code>nonce-source</code> expression, the
          server MUST generate a fresh value for the <code>nonce-value</code>
          directive at random and independently each time it transmits a policy.
          This requirement ensures that the <code>nonce-value</code> is difficult
          for an attacker to predict.</p>

          <p>Note that <code>host-char</code> contains only ASCII characters;
          internationalized domain names cannot be entered directly into a policy
          string, but are instead Punycode-encoded [[!RFC3492]]. For example, the
          domain <code>üüüüüü.de</code> would be encoded as
          <code>xn--tdaaaaaa.de</code>.</p>

	    As defined above, special URI schemes that refer to specific pieces of

            excluded from matching a policy of <code>*</code> and must be explicitly

            URIs is often derived from a response body or execution in a 
            Document context, which may be unsafe.  Expecially for the 
            <code>default-src</code> and <code>script-src</code> directives,
            policy authors should be aware that allowing "data:" URIs is
            equivalent to <code>unsafe-inline</code> and allowing "blob:" or
            "filesystem:" URIs is equivalent to <code>unsafe-eval</code>.

              <h6>Path Matching</h6>

              <p>The rules for matching source expressions that contain paths
              are simpler than they look: paths that end with the '/' character
              match all files in a directory and its subdirectories. Paths that
              do not end with the '/' character match only one specific file. A
              few examples should make this clear:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The source expression <code>example.com</code> has no path,
                and therefore matches any file served from that host.</li>

                <li>The source expression <code>example.com/scripts/</code>
                matches any file in the <code>scripts</code> directory of
                <code>example.com</code>, and any of its subdirectories. For
                example, both <code>https://example.com/scripts/file.js</code>
                and <code>https://example.com/scripts/js/file.js</code> would
                match.</li>

                <li>The source expression
                <code>example.com/scripts/file.js</code> matches only the file
                named <code>file.js</code> in the <code>scripts</code> directory
                of <code>example.com</code>.</li>

                <li>Likewise, the source expression <code>example.com/js</code>
                matches only the file named <code>js</code>. In particular, note
                that it would not match files inside a directory named
                <code>js</code>. Files like <code>example.com/js/file.js</code>
                would be matched only if the source expression ended with a
                trailing "/", as in <code>example.com/js/</code>.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Note that query strings have no impact on matching: the source
              expression <code>example.com/file?key=value</code> matches all of
              <code>https://example.com/file</code>,
              <code>https://example.com/file?key=value</code>,
              <code>https://example.com/file?key=notvalue</code>, and

                    </ul>
                    (SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 are the digest algorithms
                    <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/sha256-384-512.pdf">defined by the NIST</a>)
                  </li>
                  <li>Let <var>expected</var> be the <code>hash-value</code> component of <var>hash</var>.</li>
                  <li>Let <var>actual</var> be the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4">base64 encoding</a>

          <h4>Reporting</h4>

          <p>To <dfn>strip <code>uri</code> for reporting</dfn>, the user agent
          MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the following:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>If the origin of <var>uri</var> is a <a href="#dfn-globally-unique-identifier">globally unique identifier</a>
            (for example, <var>uri</var> has a scheme of <code>data</code>, <code>blob</code>, or <code>filesystem</code>), then
            abort these steps, and return the ASCII serialization of <var>uri</var>'s scheme.</li>
            <li>If the origin of <var>uri</var> is not the same as the origin
            of the protected resource, then abort these steps, and return the
            ASCII serialization of <var>uri</var>'s origin.</li>
            <li>Return <var>uri</var>, with any <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#concept-url-fragment">&lt;fragment&gt;</a>
            component removed.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>To <dfn>generate a violation report object</dfn>, the user agent

        <h3>Processing Model</h3>

        <p>To <dfn id="enforce">enforce</dfn> a policy, the user agent MUST
        <a href="#parse-a-policy">parse the policy</a> and enforce each of
        the directives contained in the policy, where the specific
        requirements for enforcing each directive are defined separately for
        each directive (See <a href="#sec-directives">Directives</a>,
        below).</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, enforcing a directive prevents the protected
        resource from performing certain actions, such as loading scripts from
        URIs other than those indicated in a source list. These restrictions
        make it more difficult for an attacker to abuse an injection
        vulnerability in the resource because the attacker will be unable to
        usurp the resource's privileges that have been restricted in this
        way.</p>

        <p>Note that user agents may allow users to modify or bypass policy
        enforcement through user preferences, bookmarklets, third-party
        additions to the user agent, and other such mechanisms.</p>

        <p>To <dfn id="monitor">monitor</dfn> a policy, the user agent MUST
        <a href="#parse-a-policy">parse the policy</a> and monitor each of
        the directives contained in the policy.</p>

        <p>Monitoring a directive does not prevent the protected resource from
        undertaking any actions. Instead, any actions that would have been
        prevented by the directives are instead reported to the developer of
        the web application. Monitoring a policy is useful for testing
        whether enforcing the policy will cause the web application to
        malfunction.</p>

        <p>A server MAY cause user agents to monitor one policy while enforcing
        another policy by returning both <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
        and <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header fields.
        For example, if a server operator is using one policy but wishes to
        experiment with a stricter policy, the server operator can monitor
        the stricter policy while enforcing the original policy. Once the
        server operator is satisfied that the stricter policy does not break
        the web application, the server operator can start enforcing the
        stricter policy.</p>

        <p>If the user agent monitors or enforces a policy that does not
        contain any directives, the user agent SHOULD report a warning message
        in the developer console.</p>

        <p>If the user agent monitors or enforces a policy that contains
        an unrecognized directive, the user agent SHOULD report a warning
        message in the developer console indicating the name of the
        unrecognized directive.</p>

        <p>Whenever a user agent <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#run-a-worker">runs a worker</a>:
        [[!WEBWORKERS]]</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If the worker's script's origin is a <a href="#dfn-globally-unique-identifier">globally unique identifier</a>
          (for example, the worker's script's URL has a scheme of
          <code>data</code>, <code>blob</code>, or <code>filesystem</code>), then:
          <ul>
            <li>If the user agent is enforcing a CSP policy for the <var>owner
            document</var>, the user agent MUST enforce the CSP policy for the
            worker.</li>

            <li>If the user agent is monitoring a CSP policy for the <var>owner
            document</var>, the user agent MUST monitor the CSP policy for the
            worker.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Otherwise:
          <ul>
            <li>If the worker's script is delivered with a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
            HTTP header containing the value <var>policy</var>, the user agent MUST
            <a href="#enforce">enforce <var>policy</var></a> for the
            worker.</li>
            <li>If the worker's script is delivered with a <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code>
            HTTP header containing the value <var>policy</var>, the user agent MUST
            <a href="#monitor">monitor <var>policy</var></a> for the
            worker.</li>
          </ul></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whenever a user agent creates a <a
        href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#an-iframe-srcdoc-document">an
        <code>iframe</code> <code>srcdoc</code> document</a> in a browsing
        context nested in the protected resource, if the user agent is
        enforcing any CSP policies for the protected resource, the user agent
        MUST <a href="#enforce">enforce</a> those CSP policies on the
        <code>iframe</code> <code>srcdoc</code> document as well.</p>

        <p>Whenever a user agent creates a <a
        href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#an-iframe-srcdoc-document">an
        <code>iframe</code> <code>srcdoc</code> document</a> in a browsing
        context nested in the protected resource, if the user agent is
        monitoring any CSP policies for the protected resource, the user agent
        MUST <a href="#monitor">monitor</a> those CSP policies on the
        <code>iframe</code> <code>srcdoc</code> document as well.</p>

      <p>In order to protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), web
      application authors SHOULD include
      <ul>
        <li>both the <code>script-src</code> and <code>object-src</code>
        directives, or</li>

        <li>include a <code>default-src</code> directive, which covers both
        scripts and plugins.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In either case, authors SHOULD NOT include either
      <code>'unsafe-inline'</code> or <code>data:</code> as valid sources in
      their policies. Both enable XSS attacks by allowing code to be included
      directly in the document itself; they are best avoided completely.</p>

        <h4><code>base-uri</code></h4>

        <p>The <code>base-uri</code> directive restricts the URIs that can be
        used to specify a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#document-base-url">document's base URL</a>.
        The syntax for the name and value of the directive are described by
        the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "base-uri"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>

        <p>The term <dfn>allowed base URIs</dfn> refers to the result of
        <a href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the <code>base-uri</code>
        directive's value as a source list</a>.</p>

        <p>Step 4 of the algorithm defined in HTML5 to obtain a
        <em>document's base URL</em> MUST be changed to:</p>

          <h5>Usage</h5>

          <p>JavaScript offers a few mechanisms that directly connect to an
          external server to send or receive information.
          <code>EventSource</code> maintains an open HTTP connection to a server
          in order to receive push notifications, <code>WebSockets</code>
          open a bidirectional communication channel between your browser and a
          server, and <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> makes arbitrary HTTP requests
          on your behalf. These are powerful APIs that enable useful
          functionality, but also provide tempting avenues for data
          exfiltration.
          
          <p>The <code>connect-src</code> directive allows you to ensure that
          these sorts of connections are only opened to origins you trust.
          Sending a policy that defines a list of source expressions for this
          directive is straightforward. For example, to limit connections to
          only <code>example.com</code>, send the following header:</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: connect-src example.com</pre>

          <p>All of the following will fail with the preceeding directive in
          place:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>new WebSocket("wss://evil.com/");</code></li>
            <li><code>(new XMLHttpRequest()).open("GET", "https://evil.com/", true);</code></li>
            <li><code>new EventSource("https://evil.com");</code></li>

        <h3><code>default-src</code></h3>

        <p>The <code>default-src</code> directive sets a default source list
        for a number of directives. The syntax for the name and value of the
        directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "default-src"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>

        <p>Let the <dfn>default sources</dfn> be the result of <a
        href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the <code>default-src</code>
        directive's value as a source list</a> if a <code>default-src</code>
        directive is explicitly specified, and otherwise the U+002A ASTERISK
        character (*).</p>

        <p>To enforce the <code>default-src</code> directive, the user agent
        MUST enforce the following directives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#child-src"><code>child-src</code></a></li>
          <li><a href="#connect-src"><code>connect-src</code></a></li>

          <li><a href="#style-src"><code>style-src</code></a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If not specified explicitly in the policy, the directives listed
        above will use the <a href="#dfn-default-sources">default sources</a>.</p>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Usage</h4>
          <p><code>default-src</code>, as the name implies, serves as a default
          source list which the other source list-style directives will use as
          a fallback if they're not otherwise explicitly set. That is, consider
          the following policy declaration:</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'</pre>

          <p>Under this policy, fonts, frames, images, media, objects, scripts,
          and styles will all only load from the same origin as the protected
          resource, and connections will only be made to the same origin. Adding
          a more specific declaration to the policy would completely override
          the default source list for that resource type.</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src example.com</pre>

          <p>Under this new policy, fonts, frames, and etc. continue to be load
          from the same origin, but scripts will <em>only</em> load from
          <code>example.com</code>. There's no inheritance; the
          <code>script-src</code> directive sets the allowed sources of script,
          and the default list is not used for that resource type.</p>

          <p>Given this behavior, one good way of building a policy for a site
          would be to begin with a <code>default-src</code> of
          <code>'none'</code>, and to build up a policy from there that contains
          only those resource types which are actually in use for the page you'd
          like to protect. If you don't use webfonts, for instance, there's no
          reason to specify a source list for <code>font-src</code>; specifying
          only those resource types a page uses ensures that the possible attack
          surface for that page remains as small as possible.</p>

        <h4><code>font-src</code></h4>

        <p>The <code>font-src</code> directive restricts from where the

<pre>
directive-name    = "font-src"

        <h4><code>form-action</code></h4>

        <p>The <code>form-action</code> restricts which URIs can be used as the
        action of HTML <code>form</code> elements.  The syntax for the name and
        value of the directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "form-action"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>

        <p>The term <dfn>allowed form actions</dfn> refers to the result of

        <p>Note that <code>form-action</code> does not fall back to the default

        <h4><code>frame-ancestors</code></h4>

        <p>The <code>frame-ancestors</code> directive indicates whether the user agent
        should allow embedding the resource using a <code>frame</code>, <code>iframe</code>,
        <code>object</code>, <code>embed</code> or <code>applet</code> tag, or equivalent
        functionality in non-HTML resources.  Resources can use this directive to avoid
        many UI Redressing [[UIREDRESS]] attacks by avoiding being embedded into potentially
        hostile contexts. </p>

        <p>The syntax for the name and value of the directive are described by the
        following ABNF grammar:</p>

        <pre>
directive-name  = "frame-ancestors"
directive-value = source-list
        </pre>

        <p>The term <dfn>allowed frame ancestors</dfn> refers to the result of
        <a href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the <code>frame-ancestors</code>
        directive's value as a source list</a>. Note that this directive is not
        influenced by the <a href="#dfn-default-sources">default sources</a>. If
        a <code>frame-ancestors</code> directive is not explicitly included in
        the policy, the <a href="#dfn-allowed-frame-ancestors">allowed frame
        ancestors</a> is "<code>*</code>".</p>

        <p>To enforce the <code>frame-ancestors</code> directive, whenever the
        user agent would load the protected resource into a
        <a href="#dfn-nested-browsing-context">nested browsing context</a>, the
        user agent MUST perform the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>nestedContext</var> be the nested browsing context into
          which the protected resource is being loaded.</li>
          <li>Let <var>ancestorList</var> be the list of all
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#ancestor-browsing-context">ancestor browsing contexts</a>
          of <var>nestedContext</var>.</li>

              <li>If <var>document</var>'s URL does not <a href="#matches-a-source-list">match</a>

                  <li>Act as if it received an empty
                  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.2.1">HTTP 200 response</a>.</li>
                  <li><a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#parse-a-sandboxing-directive">Parse the sandboxing directive</a>
                  using the empty string as the <em>input</em> and the newly

            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Steps 2.2 and 2.3 ensure that the blocked frame appears to be a
        normal cross-origin document's load. If these steps are ignored,
        leakage of a document's policy state is possible. The user agent MAY
        implement these steps by instead redirecting the user to friendly
        error page in a unique origin which provides the option of opening
        the blocked page in a new top-level browsing context.</p>

        <p>Note that the <code>frame-ancestors</code> directive will be ignored when
        <a href="#monitor">monitoring</a> a policy, and when a contained in a
        policy defined via a <a href="#html-meta-element"><code>meta</code>
        element</a>.</p>

        <p>Note that this directive is similar to the non-standard
        <code>X-Frame-Options</code> header that several user agents
        have implemented. The <code>'none'</code> source expression
        is roughly equivilant to that header's <code>DENY</code>,
        <code>'self'</code> to <code>SAMEORIGIN</code>, and so on.
        The major difference is that many user agents implement
        <code>SAMEORIGIN</code> such that it only matches against
        the top-level document's location. This directive checks
        each ancestor. If any ancestor doesn't match, the load
        is cancelled.</p>

        <p>The <code>frame-ancestors</code> directive <em>obsoletes</em> the
        <code>X-Frame-Options</code> header.   If a resource has both policies,
        the <code>frame-ancestors</code> policy SHOULD be enforced and the 
        <code>X-Frame-Options</code> policy SHOULD be ignored.</p>

        <p>When generating a violation report for a <code>frame-ancestors</code> violation,
        the user agent MUST NOT include the value of the embedding ancestor as a
        <code>blocked-uri</code> value unless it is same-origin with the protected resource,
        as disclosing the value of cross-origin ancestors is a violation of the Same-Origin Policy.

        <section id="multiple-host-source-values"  class="informative">
          <h5>Multiple Host Source Values</h5>

          <p>Multiple source-list espressions are allowed in a single policy (in contrast
          to <code>X-Frame-Options</code>, which allows only one) to enable
          scenarios involving embedded application compoments that are multiple levels
          below the top-level browsing context.</p>

          <p>Many common scenarios for permissioned embedding (e.g. embeddable payment,
          sharing or social apps) involve potentially many hundreds or thousands of
          valid <code>source-list</code> expressions, but it is strongly recommended against
          accomodating such scenarios with a static <code>frame-ancestors</code> directive
          listing mulitple values. In such cases it is beneficial to generate this value
          dynamically, based on an HTTP Referer header or an explicitly passed-in value,
          to allow only the source(s) necessary for each given embedding of the resource.</p>

          <p>Consider a service providing a payments application at
          <code>https://payments/makeEmbedded</code>.  The service allows this resource
          to be embedded by both merchant Alice and merchant Bob, who compete with each
          other.  Sending:</p>

<pre>
Content-Security-Policy: frame-options https://alice https://bob
</pre>

          <p>would allow Bob to re-frame Alice's resource and create fradulent clicks,
          perhaps discrediting Alice with her customers or the payments service.  If the
          payments service used additional information (e.g. as part of a URL like
          <code>https://payments/makeEmbedded?merchant=alice</code>) to send
          individually-tailored headers listing only the source-list expressions
          needed by each merchant, this attack would be eliminated.</p>

          <h5>Usage</h5>
          <p>The <code>plugin-types</code> directive whitelists a certain set
          of MIME types that can be embedded in a protected resource. For
          example, a site might want to ensure that PDF content loads, but that
          no other plugins can be instantiated. The following directive would
          satisfy that requirement:</p>
          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: plugin-types application/pdf;</pre>
          <p>Resources embedded via an <code>embed</code> or <code>object</code>
          element delivered with an <code>application/pdf</code> content type
          would be rendered in the appropriate plugin; resources delivered with
          some other content type would be blocked. Multiple types can be
          specified, in any order. If the site decided to additionally allow
          Flash at some point in the future, it could do so with the following
          directive:</p>
          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: plugin-types application/pdf application/x-shockwave-flash;</pre>
          <p>Note that wildcards are not accepted in the
          <code>plugin-types</code> directive. Only the resource types
          explicitly listed in the directive will be allowed.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
          <h5>Predeclaration of expected media types</h5>
          <p>Enforcing the <code>plugin-types</code> directive requires that
          <code>object</code> and <code>embed</code> elements declare the
          expected media type of the resource they include via the
          <code>type</code> attribute. If an author expects to load a PDF, she
          could specify this as follows:</p>
          <pre>&lt;object data="<var>resource</var>" type="application/pdf"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</pre>
          <p>If <var>resource</var> isn't actually a PDF file, it won't
          load. This prevents certain types of attacks that rely on serving
          content that unexpectedly invokes a plugin other than that which the
          author intended.</p>
          <p>Note that <var>resource</var> will not load in this scenario even
          if its media type is otherwise whitelisted: resources will only load
          when their media type is whitelisted <em>and</em> matches the
          declared type in their containing element.</p>

        <h4><code>report-uri</code></h4>

        <p>The <code>report-uri</code> directive specifies a URI to which the
        user agent sends reports about policy violation. The syntax for the
        name and value of the directive are described by the following ABNF
        grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "report-uri"
directive-value   = uri-reference *( 1*WSP uri-reference )
uri-reference     = &lt;URI-reference from RFC 3986&gt;
</pre>

        <p>The <dfn>set of report URIs</dfn> is the value of the
        <code>report-uri</code> directive, each resolved relative to the
        protected resource's URI.</p>

        <p>The process of sending violation reports to the URIs specified in
        this directive's value is defined in this document's
        <a href="#reporting">Reporting section</a>.</p>

        <p>Note that the <code>report-uri</code> directive will be ignored if

        <h4><code>sandbox</code></h4>

        <p>The <code>sandbox</code> directive specifies an HTML sandbox policy
        that the user agent applies to the protected resource. The syntax for
        the name and value of the directive are described by the following
        ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "sandbox"
directive-value   = token *( 1*WSP token )
token             = &lt;token from RFC 2616&gt;
</pre>

        <p>When enforcing the <code>sandbox</code> directive, the user agent
        MUST <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#parse-a-sandboxing-directive">parse
        the sandboxing directive</a> using the <code>directive-value</code>
        as the <em>input</em> and protected resource's
        <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#forced-sandboxing-flag-set">forced sandboxing flag set</a>
        as the output. [[!HTML5]]</p>

        <p>Note that the <code>sandbox</code> directive will be ignored when
        <a href="#monitor">monitoring</a> a policy, and when a contained in a
        policy defined via a <a href="#html-meta-element"><code>meta</code>
        element</a>.</p>

        <section class="informative">
          <h5>Usage</h5>

          <p>HTML5 defines a
          <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#attr-iframe-sandbox"><code>sandbox</code> attribute</a>
          for <code>iframe</code> elements, intended to allow web authors to
          reduce the risk of including potentially untrusted content by imposing
          restrictions on that content's abilities. When the attribute is set,
          the content is forced into a unique origin, prevented from submitting
          forms, running script, creating or navigating other browsing contexts,
          and prevented from running plugins. These restrictions can be loosened
          by setting certain flags as the attribute's value.</p>

          <p>The <code>sandbox</code> directive allows any resource, framed or
          not, to ask for the same sorts of restrictions to be applied to
          itself.</p>

          <p>For example, a message board or email system might provide
          downloads of arbitrary attachments provided by other users. Attacks
          that rely on tricking a client into rendering one of these attachments
          could be mitigated by requesting that resources only be rendered in a
          very restrictive sandbox. Sending the <code>sandbox</code> directive
          with an empty value establishes such an environment:</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: sandbox</pre>

          <p>More trusted resources might be allowed to run in an environment
          with fewer restrictions by adding <code>allow-*</code> flags to the
          directive's value. For example, you can allow a page that you trust
          to run script, while ensuring that it isn't treated as same-origin
          with the rest of your site. This can be accomplished by sending the
          <code>sandbox</code> directive with the <code>allow-scripts</code>
          flag:</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts</pre>

          <p>The set of flags available to the CSP directive should match those
          available to the <code>iframe</code> attribute. Currently, those
          include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>allow-forms</code></li>
            <li><code>allow-pointer-lock</code></li>
            <li><code>allow-popups</code></li>
            <li><code>allow-same-origin</code></li>
            <li><code>allow-scripts</code>, and</li>
            <li><code>allow-top-navigation</code></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Note as well that, like the rest of Content Security Policy, the
          <code>sandbox</code> directive is meant as a defense-in-depth. Web
          authors would be well-served to use it <em>in addition to</em>
          standard sniffing-mitigation and privilege-reduction techniques.</p>

          <h5>Nonce usage for <code>script</code> elements</h5>

          <p>The <code>script-src</code> directive lets developers specify exactly
          which script elements on a page were intentionally included
          for execution. Ideally, developers would avoid inline script entirely
          and whitelist scripts by URL.  However, in some cases, removing inline
          scripts can be difficult or impossible. For those cases, developers can
          whitelist scripts using a randomly generated nonce.</p>

          <p>Usage is straightforward. For <em>each</em> request, the server
          generates a unique value at random, and includes it in the
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header:</p>

<pre>
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://example.com 'nonce-<em>$RANDOM</em>'
</pre>
          <p>This same value is then applied as a <code>nonce</code> attribute
          to each <code>script</code> element that ought to be executed. For example,
          if the server generated the random value <code>Nc3n83cnSAd3wc3Sasdfn939hc3</code>,
          the server would send the following policy:</p>

<pre>
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://example.com 'nonce-Nc3n83cnSAd3wc3Sasdfn939hc3'
</pre>

          <p>Script elements can then execute either because their <code>src</code>
          URLs are whitelisted or because they have an appropriate nonce:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script&gt;
alert("Blocked because the policy doesn't have 'unsafe-inline'.")
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script nonce="EDNnf03nceIOfn39fn3e9h3sdfa"&gt;
alert("Still blocked because nonce is wrong.")
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script nonce="Nc3n83cnSAd3wc3Sasdfn939hc3"&gt;
alert("Allowed because nonce is valid.")
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src="https://example.com/allowed-because-of-src.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script nonce="EDNnf03nceIOfn39fn3e9h3sdfa"
        src="https://elsewhere.com/blocked-because-nonce-is-wrong.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script nonce="Nc3n83cnSAd3wc3Sasdfn939hc3"
        src="https://elsewhere.com/allowed-because-nonce-is-valid.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

          <p>Note that the nonce's value is <em>not</em> a hash or signature
          that verifies the contents of the script resources. It's quite simply
          a random string that informs the user agent which scripts were
          intentionally included in the page.</p>

          <p>Script elements with the proper nonce execute, regardless of
          whether they're inline or external. Script elements without the
          proper nonce don't execute unless their URLs are whitelisted.
          Even if an attacker is able to inject markup into the protected
          resource, the attack will be blocked by the attacker's inability
          to guess the random value.</p>

        <section class="informative">
          <h5>Hash usage for <code>script</code> elements</h5>

          <p>The <code>script-src</code> directive lets developers whitelist a
          particular inline script by specifying its hash as an allowed source
          of script.</p>

          <p>Usage is straightforward. The server computes the hash of a
          particular script block's contents, and includes the base64 encoding
          of that value in the <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header:</p>

<pre>
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://example.com 'sha256-<var>base64 encoded hash</var>'
</pre>

          <p>Each inline script block's contents are hashed, and compared against
          the whitelisted value. If there's a match, the script is executed. For
          example, the SHA-256 digest of <code>alert('Hello, world.');</code> is
          <code>YWIzOWNiNzJjNDRlYzc4MTgwMDhmZDlkOWI0NTAyMjgyY2MyMWJlMWUyNjc1ODJlYWJhNjU5MGU4NmZmNGU3OAo=</code>.
          If the server sent the following header:</p>

<pre>
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'sha256-YWIzOWNiNzJjNDRlYzc4MTgwMDhmZDlkOWI0NTAyMjgyY2MyMWJlMWUyNjc1ODJlYWJhNjU5MGU4NmZmNGU3OAo='
</pre>

          <p>Then the following script tag would result in script execution:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script&gt;alert('Hello, world.');&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

          <p>Note that whitespace is significant. The following scripts blocks would
          not hash to the same value, and would therefore <em>not</em> execute:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script&gt; alert('Hello, world.');&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;alert('Hello, world.'); &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt; alert('Hello, world.'); &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  alert('Hello, world.');
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

          <p>Note also that the hash applies <em>only</em> to inline script. An externalized
          script containing the value <code>alert('Hello, world.');</code> would <em>not</em>
          execute if its origin was not whitelisted as a valid source of script.</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'</pre>

        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> An auction site wishes to load images
        from any URI, plugin content from a list of trusted media providers
        (including a content distribution network), and scripts only from a
        server under its control hosting sanitized ECMAScript:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src *;
                         object-src media1.example.com media2.example.com *.cdn.example.com;
                         script-src trustedscripts.example.com</pre>

        <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Online banking site wishes to ensure that all of the content
        in its pages is loaded over TLS to prevent attackers from eavesdropping on insecure content
        requests:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'</pre>

        <p>This policy allows inline content (such as inline <code>script</code> elements), use of
        <code>eval</code>, and loading resources over <code>https</code>.  Note: This policy does
        not provide any protection from cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.</p>

        <p><strong>Example 4:</strong> A website that relies on inline
        <code>script</code> elements wishes to ensure that script is only
        executed from its own origin, and those elements it intentionally
        inserted inline:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'nonce-<em>$RANDOM</em>';</pre>

        <p>The inline <code>script</code> elements would then only execute if
        they contained a matching <code>nonce</code> attribute:</p>

        <pre>&lt;script nonce="<em>$RANDOM</em>"&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

        <h3>Sample Violation Report</h3>

        <p>This section contains an example violation report the user agent
        might sent to a server when the protected resource violations a sample
        policy.</p>

        <p>In the following example, the user agent rendered a representation
        of the resource <code>http://example.org/page.html</code> with the
        following policy:</p>

<pre>default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.org/csp-report.cgi</pre>

        <p>The protected resource loaded an image from
        <code>http://evil.example.com/image.png</code>, violating the
        policy.</p>

        <pre>{
  "csp-report": {
    "document-uri": "http://example.org/page.html",
    "referrer": "http://evil.example.com/haxor.html",
    "blocked-uri": "http://evil.example.com/image.png",
    "violated-directive": "default-src 'self'",
    "effective-directive": "img-src",
    "original-policy": "default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.org/csp-report.cgi"
  }

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) Parsing</h3>

        <p>The <code>style-src</code> directive restricts the locations from
        which the protected resource can load styles. However, if the user agent uses a
        lax CSS parsing algorithm, an attacker might be able to trick the user
        agent into accepting malicious "style sheets" hosted by an otherwise
        trustworthy origin.</p>

        <p>These attacks are similar to the <a
        href="http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/12/generic-cross-browser-cross-domain.html">CSS
        cross-origin data leakage</a> attack described by Chris Evans in 2009.
        User agents SHOULD defend against both attacks using the same
        mechanism: stricter CSS parsing rules for style sheets with improper
        MIME types.</p>

        <h3>Violation Reports</h3>

        <p>The violation reporting mechanism in this document has been
        designed to mitigate the risk that a malicious web site could use
        violation reports to probe the behavior of other servers. For example,
        consider a malicious web site that white lists <code>https://example.com</code>
        as a source of images. If the malicious site attempts to load
        <code>https://example.com/login</code> as an image, and the
        <code>example.com</code> server redirects to an identity provider (e.g.,
        <code>idenityprovider.example.net</code>), CSP will block the request.
        If violation reports contained the full blocked URI, the violation
        report might contain sensitive information contained in the redirected URI,
        such as session identifiers or purported identities. For this reason, the
        user agent includes only the origin of the blocked URI.</p>

      <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>

      <p>The <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header is an end-to-end
      header.  It is processed and enforced at the client and, therefore,
      SHOULD NOT be modified or removed by proxies or other intermediaries not
      in the same administrative domain as the resource.</p>

      <p>The originating administrative domain for a resource might wish to
      apply a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header outside of the
      immediate context of an application.  For example, a large organization
      might have many resources and applications managed by different
      individuals or teams but all subject to a uniform organizational
      standard. In such situations, a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
      header might be added or combined with an existing one at a network-edge
      security gateway device or web application firewall.  To enforce multiple
      policies, the administrator SHOULD combine the policy into a single header.
      An administrator might wish to use different combination algorithms
      depending on his or her intended semantics.</p>

      <p>One sensible policy combination algorithm is to start by allowing a
      default set of sources and then letting individual upstream resource
      owners expand the set of allowed sources by including additional origins.
      In this approach, the resultant policy is the union of all allowed
      origins in the input policies.</p>

      <p>Another sensible policy combination algorithm is to intersect the
      given policies.  This approach enforces that content comes from a certain
      whitelist of origins, for example, preventing developers from including
      third-party scripts or content in violation of organizational standards
      and practices.  In this approach, the combination algorithm forms the
      combined policy by removing disallowed hosts from the policies supplied
      by upstream resource owners.</p>

      <p>Interactions between the <code>default-src</code> and other directives
      SHOULD be given special consideration when combining policies.  If none
      of the policies contains a <code>default-src</code> directive, adding new
      src directives results in a more restrictive policy.  However, if one or
      more of the input policies contain a <code>default-src</code> directive,
      adding new src directives might result in a less restrictive policy, for
      example, if the more specific directive contains a more permissive set of
      allowed origins.</p>

      <p>Using a more restrictive policy than the input policy authored by the
      resource owner might prevent the resource from rendering or operating as
      intended.</p>

      <p>Note also that migration to <code>HTTPS</code> from <code>HTTP</code>
      may require updates to the policy in order to keep things running as
      before. Source expressions like <code>http://example.com</code> do
      <em>not</em> match <code>HTTPS</code> resources. For example,
      administrators SHOULD carefully examine existing policies before rolling
      out <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a>
      headers for an application.</p>

      <p>The permanent message header field registry (see [<a
