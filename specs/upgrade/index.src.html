  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Increasingly, we encourage authors to transition their sites and applications
  away from insecure transport, and onto encrypted and authenticated connections
  [[WEB-HTTPS]]. While this migration has significant advantages for both
  authors and users, it isn't without negative side-effects.

  Most notably, mixed content checking [[MIX]] has the potential to cause real
  headache for administrators tasked with moving substantial amounts of legacy
  content onto HTTPS. In particular, going through old content and rewriting
  subresource URLs manually is a huge undertaking. Moreover, it's often the case
  that truly legacy content is difficult or impossible to update. Consider the
  BBC's archived websites [[BBC-ARCHIVE]], or the New York Times' hard-coded
  URLs [[NYT-HTTPS]]. 
  
  We should remove this burden from site authors by allowing them to assert to a
  user agent that they intend a site to load only secure resources, and that
  insecure URLs ought to be treated as though they had been replaced with secure
  URLs.

  This document defines a new Content Security Policy directive,
  <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code>, through which authors can make
  this assertion, allowing a user agent to treat the following HTML code:

  <pre>
    &lt;img src="http://example.com/image.png"&gt;
  </pre>

  as though it had been delivered as:

  <pre>
    &lt;img src="https://example.com/image.png"&gt;
  </pre>

  The URL will be rewritten before the request is made, meaning that no insecure
  requests will hit the network. Users will be safer, and authors and
  administrators will be happier.

  Note: Delivering the policy as a header allows an administrator to easily
  opt a set of pages into the upgrade mechanism without touching their source
  code individually. The legacy content examples above would not be feasible
  with an approach that inlined the policy into HTML, for example.

  <h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading Insecure Resource Requests</h2>

  In order to allow authors to mitigate the negative side-effects of migration
  away from <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> insecure origins</a>, authors may
  instruct the user agent to transparently upgrade resource requests to
  <a>potentially secure</a> variants of the original request's URL.

  To support this instruction, <a>environment settings objects</a> and
  <a>browsing contexts</a> have an <dfn>upgrade insecure resource requests
  flag</dfn> which is set to <code>No Upgrade</code> unless otherwise specified.
  This flag is checked in [[#upgrade-request]] in order to determine whether or
  not resource requests should be upgraded during <a>Fetching</a>.

  <h3 id="delivery">Upgrade Policy Delivery</h3>

  A server MAY instruct a user agent to upgrade insecure resource requests for
  a particular <a>protected resource</a> by sending a
  <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header [[!CSP]] that contains a
  <dfn>upgrade-insecure-requests</dfn> directive, defined via the following ABNF
  grammar:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "upgrade-insecure-requests"
    directive-value = ""
  </pre>

  When <a>enforcing</a> the <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code> directive,
  set the <a>protected resource</a>'s <a>incumbent settings object</a>'s
  <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a> to <code>Enforced
  Upgrade</code>.

  When <a>monitoring</a> the <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code> directive,
  set the <a>protected resource</a>'s <a>incumbent settings object</a>'s
  <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a> to <code>Monitored
  Upgrade</code>.

  <div class="example">
    For example, sending the following header with a document will ensure that
    subresource requests are upgraded, and that reports are sent out for each
    upgrade:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: <a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a>;
                               report-uri /upgrade-endpoint
    </pre>

    Sending the following header will not upgrade requests, but will send
    reports:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a>: <a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a>;
                                           report-uri /upgrade-endpoint
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h3 id="nesting">Policy Inheritance</h3>

  If a {{Document}}'s <a>incumbent settings object</a>'s <a>upgrade insecure
  resource requests flag</a> is set to <code>true</code>, the user agent MUST
  ensure that all <a>nested browsing contexts</a> inherit the setting in the
  following ways:

  <ol>
    <li>
      When a <a>nested browsing context</a> <var>context</var> is created, set
      its <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a> to <code>true</code> if
      <var>context</var>'s <a>embedding document</a>'s <a>upgrade insecure
      resource requests flag</a> is set to <code>true</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      When <a>creating a new <code>Document</code> object</a>, set its
      <a>incumbent settings object</a>'s <a>upgrade insecure resource requests
      flag</a> to <code>true</code> if its <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>upgrade
      insecure resource requests flag</a> is <code>true</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="upgrade-request">
    Upgrade <var>request</var> to a potentially secure URL, if appropriate
  </h3>

  Given a {{Request}} <var>request</var>, this algorithm will rewrite its
  {{Request/url}} if the {{Request/client}} from which the request originates
  has opted-in to upgrades.

  We will not upgrade navigational requests, with the exception of form
  submissions. Form submissions will be upgraded to mitigate the risk of data
  leakage via plaintext submissions.

  ISSUE: This should be called from Fetch, probably after the existing step #3.
  Hi, Anne!

  <ol>
    <li>
      If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/context-frame-type}} is
      <code>top-level</code> or <code>auxiliary</code>, and its
      {{Request/context}} is <strong>not</strong> <code>form</code>,
      return without modifying <var>request</var>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}} is <a>potentially secure</a>,
      return without modifying <var>request</var>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let <var>upgrade state</var> be the result of executing
      [[#should-upgrade-for-client]] upon <var>request</var>'s {{Request/client}}.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>upgrade state</var> is <code>No Upgrade</code>, return without
      modifying <var>request</var>. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Execute [[#report-an-upgrade]] on <var>request</var>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>upgrade state</var> is <code>Monitored Upgrade</code>, return
      without modifying <var>request</var>. 
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}}'s {{URL/scheme}} is
      <code>http</code>, set <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}}'s
      {{URL/scheme}} to <code>https</code>, and return.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}}'s {{URL/scheme}} is
      <code>ws</code>, set <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}}'s
      {{URL/scheme}} to <code>wss</code>, and return.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="should-upgrade-for-client">
    Should insecure {{Request}}s be upgraded for <var>client</var>?
  </h3>

  Given an {{Request}}'s {{Request/client}} <var>client</var> (an <a>environment
  settings object</a>), this algorithm returns <code>Enforced Upgrade</code> if
  <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> insecure</a> requests associated with that client
  should be upgraded, <code>Monitored Upgrade</code> if requests should be
  reported (via [[#report-an-upgrade]]) but not actually upgraded, and <code>No
  Upgrade</code> otherwise. In short, this will check the client and return the
  appropriate <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a> set on it or its
  <a>browsing context</a>.

  <ol>
    <li>
      If <var>client</var> has a <a>responsible document</a>, return the value
      of its <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a>.

      Note: This catches {{Document}}s or {{Worker}}s whose flag is set directly
      by the <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive, or which
      have inherited the flag from an <a>embedding document</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>client</var> has a <a>responsible browsing context</a>, return the
      value of its <a>upgrade insecure resource requests flag</a>.

      Note: This catches requests triggered from detached {{Request/client}}s.
      Not sure this is necessary, really, given the inheritence structure
      defined in [[#nesting]].
    </li>
    <li>
      Return <code>No Upgrade</code>. 
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="report-an-upgrade">
    Report an upgrade for <var>request</var>
  </h3>

  When a {{Request}} is upgraded, a CSP violation is triggered with the intent
  of informing authors that resources on their sites will fail to load in
  user agents that do not support this upgrade mechanism.

  Note: This violation report will be triggered for the {{Document}} or
  {{Worker}} that triggers the request. This might or might not be the same
  <a>protected resource</a> that set the
  <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive, due to [[#nesting]].
  See [[#violation-report-target]] for detail.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <a>Report a violation</a> for <var>request</var>'s {{Request/client}}'s
      <a>responsible document</a>, using
      <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> as the
      <code>violated-directive</code> and <code>effective-directive</code>,
      and <var>request</var>'s {{Request/url}} as the <code>blocked-uri</code>.

  <h2 id="websockets-integration">Modifications to WebSockets</h2>

  WebSockets do not use the <a>Fetching</a> algorithm, so we need to handle

  The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-4.1">Establish a

  <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="hsts">Interaction with HSTS</h3>

  The <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive does not replace
  the <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> HTTP response header [[RFC6797]].
  Authors who serve their site over secure transport SHOULD send that header
  with an appropriate <code>max-age</code> in order to ensure that users are
  not subject to SSL stripping attacks by maliciously active network attackers.

  <h3 id="violation-report-target">CSP Violation Reports</h3>

  When sending a violation report for an upgraded resource, user agents MUST
  target the {{Document}} or {{Worker}} that triggered the request, rather
  than the {{Document}} or {{Worker}} on which the
  <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive was set. Due to
  [[#nesting]], the latter might be a cross-origin ancestor of the former, and
  sending violation reports to that set of reporting endpoints could leak data
  in unexpected ways.

  Likewise, the <code>SecurityPolicyViolationEvent</code> MUST NOT target any
  {{Document}} other than the one which triggered the request, for the same
  reasons.

  <h2 id="authoring">Authoring Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="legacy-clients">Legacy Clients</h3>

  Legacy clients which do support mixed content blocking [[MIX]], but do not
  support the <code><a>upgrade-insecure-requests</a></code> directive will
  continue to have a suboptimal experience on pages which contain
  <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> insecure URLs</a>. Authors SHOULD ensure that
  they collect <a lt="send violation reports">violation reports</a> in order
  to determine which resources are most problematic for their users, and SHOULD
  use that information to prioritize fixes for URLs in legacy content that
  users will most likely request.
