Abstract:
  Entry Point Regulation aims to mitigate the risk of reflected cross-site
  scripting (XSS), cross-site script inclusion (XSSI), and cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attacks by demarcating the areas of an application which are
  intended to be externally referencable.  A specified policy is applied on
  external requests for all non-demarcated resources.

<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Entry Point Regulation intends to provide defense-in-depth against reflected
  cross-site scripting and other content injection (XSS), cross-site script
  inclusion (XSSI), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

  These attacks all rely on the fundamentally porous nature of the web: any
  addressable portion of an application can be requested by any third-party,
  with arbitrary <a for="URL">query</a> parameters and <a for="URL">fragment</a>
  identifiers. The user agent will happily issue such requests with all the
  authority granted to the user, which can result in a number of problems.

  If an author can limit incoming traffic to a strict set of well-audited entry
  points, web applications can reduce the risk these attacks present, and indeed
  some authors have taken steps to do so via server-side logic, single page
  application (SPA) frameworks, (and, soon, via Service Workers). Server-side
  techniques can be an effective solution, but have a number of drawbacks.
  Complexity to the side, they are prone to false-positive restrictions in cases
  where a user's intent should override the author's intent (bookmarked links,
  for instance).

  This document defines a browser-enforced mechanism which can be layered on top
  of an existing application without server-side modifications, providing the
  attack mitigation authors desire, while allowing user intent to trump brittle
  filters when possible.

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  The threat model EPR operates under assumes that the user is authenticated to
  various web applications and origins within a single browser, and that the user
	browses to web content that may be malicious.  Web content can freely make
	authenticated cross-origin requests, enabling XSS, CSRF, and XSSI attacks.
	While CSP has shown to be an effective approach to addressing XSS, the protection
	CSP provides is only as good as the policies web applications are able to put into
	place. In many cases enforcing optimally secure CSP policies has proven difficult,
  for example when web content needs to leverage JavaScript libraries requiring
  eval().  EPR provides a defense-in-depth option for authors to mitigate XSS
  while also providing a new opportunity to mitigate CSRF and XSSI attacks.

  After an author implements EPR for an origin, the following statements ought
  to hold:

  1.  Authors should be able to block incoming requests based on the
      <a for="request">URL</a> being requested. That is, a request for
      <code>/</code> might be allowed, while a request for
      <code>/api/logout.cgi</code> might be denied.

      Modifications might include stripping <a for="URL">query</a> and
      <a for="URL">fragment</a> data from the request's URL, or stripping
      cookies and other authentication information.

  2.  Authors should be able to block or modify incoming requests that contain
      data (e.g. the URL might have <a for="URL">query</a> or
      <a for="URL">fragment</a> data, or the request might contain a
      <a for="request">body</a>) differently from requests that do not contain
      data.

  3.  Authors should be able to block or modify incoming requests based on the
      request's <a for="request">context</a>; that is, navigations create
      different attack surfaces than subresource inclusions, and should be
      treated differently.

  4.  Requests should be excluded from the above filters if the request
      originates from a same-origin source. That is, any page on
      <code>https://example.com/</code> may request any resource on that origin,
      while requests from <code>https://not-example.com/</code> would be
      restricted.

  5.  A user agent may choose to exclude other requests from the above filters
      in order to prioritize a user's intent. For instance, URLs typed directly
      into the address bar or bookmarked URLs might skip filters entirely.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  The developer of a web-based "Internet of Things" administration console
  would like to have a high degree of assurance that XSS and CSRF attacks will
  not affect users.  If such an attack were to occur it could allow attackers
  to turn users' home appliances on and off at will, or perform other actions
  with serious consequences.  Because of the pervasive nature of XSS and CSRF
  vulnerabilities, the developer had been considering creating only monolithic
  desktop and mobile applications as opposed to utilizing the web platform.
  While this would allow them to sidestep the security concerns inherent with
  the web platform, it is clearly not ideal for users.  Implementation of CSP
  seemed to present a solution, however a fully restrictive policy is not
  possible due to library compatibility requirements.

  The developer decides to implement Entry Point Regulation.  They create a
  manifest specifying a default policy to block external requests by default.
  The developer lists out each entry point path in their manifest.  Testing
  is first performed in report-only mode, and the blocking behavior is only
  enabled once the developer is comfortable with the behavior of EPR.

  <h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts and Terminology</h2>

  EPR categorizes <a>requests</a> as follows:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <dfn>navigational request</dfn> if its <a for="request">context frame
      type</a> is one of "<code>top-level</code>", "<code>auxiliary</code>",
      or "<code>nested</code>". Navigational requests load a resource into a
      context where markup will be rendered, meaning that they place an origin
      at risk of both XSS and CSRF attack.
    </li>
    <li>
      <dfn>subresource request</dfn> if it is not a <a>connection request</a>,
      and its <a for="request">context frame type</a> is "<code>none</code>".
      Subresource requests cannot execute code directly, so the XSS risk is
      minimal, but they do present the risk of CSRF and XSSI.
    </li>
    <li>
      <dfn>connection request</dfn> if its <a for="request">context</a> is one
      of "<code>beacon</code>", "<code>cspreport</code>",
      "<code>eventsource</code>", "<code>fetch</code>", "<code>ping</code>", or
      "<code>xmlhttprequest</code>". These connection types are distinguished
      from subresource requests only because of their flexibility
      (<code>POST</code> vs <code>GET</code>, etc) and their typical usage
      (API endpoints vs static resources). The risks are similar, but authors
      may wish to set different rules for these kinds of requests than they
      would for other subresource requests.
    </li>
  </ol>

ISSUE: In the interest of keeping manifest creation simple, we should consider
merging subresource and connection requests into a single category.
Navigations are susceptable to XSS, whereas this is not a concern for
subresource and connection requests.  If there isn't a similar very specific
distinction between attacks that would involve subresource and connection
requests than we should merge them.

ISSUE: It could make sense to split out IMAGE SRC, SCRIPT SRC, etc. requests.
It should be very easy for a manifest author to tag individual rules in
the manifest so that images would be available to IMG tags on a different
origin, but not SCRIPT tags.  If we can identify a very specific attack
scenario where this is useful then it makes sense to do this.

  An <dfn export>EPR store</dfn> is an opaque storage mechanism which offers a
  user agent the ability to save, retrieve, and modify <a>EPR manifests</a> on
  a per-origin basis. The implementation is vendor-specific, and the interface
  provided is not exposed to the web.

  The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation is specified in [[!RFC5234]].

  <h2 id="framework">Framework</h2>

  In a nutshell:

  <ol>
    <li>
      UA requests a resource from <code>example.com</code> for the very
      first time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>example.com</code> responds with a document that has an
      <code><a>EPR</a></code> header, which tells the UA that it should
      regulate entry points for the origin.

			As no <a>EPR manifest</a>, and therefore no policy, is
      available for this request, a <a>default EPR policy</a> will apply
      as described in [[#default-policy]].

      Somewhere in Fetch after we have the headers, we'll call out to
      [[#process-epr-header]] to take whatever actions we need to take
      here. This means we'll grab an <a>EPR manifest</a> file, and
      store it persistently for use in regulating future requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      Subsequent navigations and resource requests from <code>example.com</code>
      will run through [[#process-request]] to determine whether they <a>match</a>
      the ruleset defined in the <a>EPR manifest</a> we processed above.

      If they don't match a ruleset, the user agent will take some action, as
      described in [[#manifest-behaviors]].
    </li>
    <li>
      That's it!
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="epr-header">The <code>EPR</code> HTTP Response Header Field</h3>

  Servers may request the protections outlined in this document by sending an
  <dfn local-lt="EPR"><code>EPR</code> HTTP response header field</dfn> along
  with a response. This request is represented by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    "EPR:" *<a>WSP</a> "1" *<a>WSP</a>
  </pre>

  User agent conformance details upon receipt of such a header are explained in
  [[#process-epr-header]].

  <h3 id="manifest">Entry Point Manifests</h3>

  An <dfn>EPR manifest</dfn> is a JSON file containing entry point regulation
  policy data for an <a>origin</a>.

  Servers which opt-in to EPR protections via the <code><a>EPR</a></code> header
  MUST make a manifest file available via [[MANIFEST]].  EPR rules are included
  in a manifest via the <code>epr_manifest</code> attribute.

ISSUE: "epr_manifest" attribute inconsistent (?) with "epr" member as described
below.

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      {
        ...,
        "<a dict-member>epr</a>": {
          "<a dict-member>reportURL</a>": "https://example.com/reporting-endpoint",
          "<a dict-member>redirectURL</a>": "https://example.com/",
          "<a dict-member>navigationBehavior</a>": "<a>allowStrippedGET</a>",
          "<a dict-member>subresourceBehavior</a>": "<a>allowStrippedGET</a>",
          "<a dict-member>rules</a>": [
            {
              "<a dict-member>path</a>": "/",
              "<a dict-member>types</a>": [ "navigational" ],
              "<a dict-member>allowData</a>": false
            },
            {
              "<a dict-member>regex</a>": "^/\\d+$",
              "<a dict-member>types</a>": [ "navigational" ],
              "<a dict-member>allowData</a>": false
            },
            ...
            {
              "<a dict-member>path</a>": "/image",
              "<a dict-member>types</a>": [ "subresource" ],
              "<a dict-member>allowData</a>": true
            },
          ]
        }
      }
    </pre>
  </div>

  ISSUE: It isn't clear that the EPR manifest ought to be part of an application
  manifest as defined in [[MANIFEST]]. We've lumped it in there at the moment
  because it seems worth trying out, but it's not clear that the concepts
  (though similar) mesh as well as they need to.

  <h4 id="manifest-epr">The <code>epr</code> manifest member</h4>

  The policy data that makes up the <a>EPR manifest</a> is delivered via an
  <dfn dict-member for="EPR Manifest"><code>epr</code></dfn> member of an
  application manifest [[!MANIFEST]]. This member's value is an dictionary
  adhering to the following IDL:

  <pre class="idl">
    enum EPRBehavior {
      "allow",
      "block",
      "redirect",
      "omitCredentials",
      "allowStrippedGET"
    };

    dictionary EPRPolicy {
      USVString? reportURL;
      USVString? redirectURL;
      EPRBehavior navigationBehavior = "allowStrippedGET";
      EPRBehavior subresourceBehavior = "allowStrippedGET";
      sequence&lt;EPRRule&gt; rules;
    };
  </pre>
  <dl dfn-for="EPRPolicy">
    <dt><dfn dict-member>reportURL</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A URL to which violation reports will be sent. See [[#reporting]] for user
      agent conformance requirements.

      Note: Authors may use the <a>allow</a> behavior to simulate a
      "report only" mode that does not actually modify incoming <a>requests</a>
      but does send reports back to the report URL.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn dict-member>redirectURL</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A URL to redirect to when using the <a>redirect</a> behavior.

    <dd>
      If a navigational request doesn't <a>match</a> {{EPRPolicy/rules}}, this
      property defines the action the user agent will take. Detailed conformance
      requirements can be found in [[#process-request]], and a high-level
      description of the behaviors can be found in [[#manifest-behaviors]].
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn dict-member>subresourceBehavior</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      If a non-navigational request doesn't <a>match</a> {{EPRPolicy/rules}}, this

    <dd>
      The ruleset which should be applied. Details are in [[#manifest-ruleset]].
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h4 id="manifest-ruleset">Ruleset</h4>

  EPR manifests define a set of <dfn>rules</dfn> for a site, governing a user
  agent's <a>fetching</a> behavior for <a>requests</a> made to that site's
  <a>origin</a>. Each rule is scoped to a specific subset of an origin's
  URLs via a path prefix or a regular expression. Incoming <a>requests</a>
  which do not match the ruleset (as defined in [[#matching]]) will be dealt
  with as defined in {{EPRPolicy/navigationBehavior}} or
  {{EPRPolicy/subresourceBehavior}}, as appropriate.

  The following IDL defines rules' syntax:

  <pre class="idl">
    enum EPRRequestType {
      "connection", "navigational", "subresource"
    };

    dictionary EPRRule {
      USVString? path;

  </pre>
  <dl dfn-for="EPRRule">
    <dt><dfn dict-member>path</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A path prefix defining a <a>rule</a>'s scope. See [[#matching]] for user
      agent conformance requirements. One {{EPRRule/path}} or {{EPRRule/regex}}
      may be specified for a given rule, but not both.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn dict-member>regex</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A regular expression, defining a <a>rule</a>'s scope. See [[#matching]]
      for user agent conformance requirements. One {{EPRRule/path}} or
      {{EPRRule/regex}} may be specified for a given rule, but not both.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn dict-member>types</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A set of request types to which this rule applies: the values MUST be one
      or more of "<code>navigational</code>" (which encompasses <a>navigational
      requests</a>), "<code>subresource</code>" (<a>subresource requests</a>),
      or "<code>connection</code>" (<a>connection requests</a>). See
      [[#matching]] for user agent conformance requirements.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn dict-member>allowData</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      If <code>true</code>, then matching <a>requests</a>'
      <a for="request">URL</a>s are allowed to contain non-empty
      <a for="URL">query</a> and <a for="URL">fragment</a> properties,
      and <a>requests</a>' <a for="request">body</a> may be non-null.

      See [[#process-request]] for user agent conformance requirements.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h4 id="manifest-behaviors">Behaviors</h4>

  If a <a>request</a> does not <a>match</a> the ruleset defined in an <a>EPR
  manifest</a>'s {{EPRPolicy/rules}} property, then the user agent looks to
  either {{EPRPolicy/navigationBehavior}} or {{EPRPolicy/subresourceBehavior}}
  to determine what action to take.

  The following behaviors are defined (and, if none is explicitly specified,
  then <a>allowStrippedGET</a> is used as a default):

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>allow</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Allow the request without modification. This behavior may be used to
      put the user agent in a "report only" mode, where violations are reported
      (as described in [[#reporting]]), but requests proceed without
      modification.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>block</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Cancel the request entirely, returning a <a>network error</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>redirect</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Redirect the request to a specified URL.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>omitCredentials</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Drop cookies and other authentication properties of the request by
      setting it's <a for="request">credentials mode</a> to
      "<code>omit</code>".
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>allowStrippedGET</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Allow <code>GET</code> requests, after setting its
      <a for="request">url</a>'s <a for="URL">fragment</a> and
      <a for="URL">query</a> properties to <code>null</code>.

      <code>POST</code> and other request types will be canceled, returning a
      <a>network error</a>.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  User agent conformance requirements are defined in [[#process-request]].

<h4 id="manifest-caching">Caching</h4>

EPR manifest files are cached as per standard policy served in HTTP headers.
Manifest files are removed if the user clears their browser cache, as is
any persistent indication that EPR has been enabled by the site (as may have
been indicated by a HTTP response header).  When a manifest file expires from
the cache, the user agent should attempt to download the manifest file again
when possible.  At minimum this should occur on the next request to the
EPR-enabled site.

      Given <var>matched</var> is <var>false</var>, the user agent should
      initiate a new background manifest download.  It is possible that a
      policy author might make a mistake and deploy a policy that
      inappropriately blocks access to resources.  So initiating a new
      download when a policy action is applied prevents broken manifests
      from persisting in the cache.  The user agent may choose to
      implement heuristics so as to avoid excessive manifest download
      attempts.  For example, by never attempting to re-download a
      manifest more than once an hour.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="default-policy">
    Default EPR policy
  </h3>

  A default policy MUST be applied when all of the following criteria are
  met:
  <ul>
    <li>An EPR header has been received by the user agent indicating that the
    site site has opted-in to EPR.</li>
    <li>No EPR manifest is currently available.  (Possibly because it hasn't
    been downloaded yet, it failed to parse, etc.</li>
    <li>The request is a <a>navigational request</a>.</li>
    <li>The request was initiated by a cross-origin web site, not by the
    user's selection of a bookmark or by the user typing an address into the
    address bar.</li>
  </ul>

  The <dfn>default EPR policy</dfn> specifies the <a>allowStrippedGET</a>
  behavior is applied to requests, preventing requests from containing data
  that would enable reflected or DOM-based XSS.

  ISSUE: Allow data on everything under a specific hardcoded path, in order to
  facilitate URLs sent in e-mail, etc.?

  The intent of the default EPR policy is to mitigate XSS (not CSRF) when no
  EPR policy is available yet.  Even when the user is not authenticated to
  a site, XSS is problematic because the attack may persist until the user
  has authenticated.  This is not the case with CSRF, and CSRF is not
  effective until the user has authenticated to a site, at which point it is
  much more likely that a policy has been downloaded.

  <h3 id="process-epr-header">
    Process <var>response</var>'s <code>EPR</code> header
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (<var>response</var>), this algorithm parses its
  <a for="response">header list</a> to extract an <code><a>EPR</a></code>
  header field. If such a field is present as EPR: 1, the user agent MUST
  fetch and process an <a>EPR manifest</a> from <var>response</var>'s
  <a>origin</a> unless one or more of the following statements is true:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <var>response</var>'s <a>request</a>'s <a for="request">context</a> is
      <code>manifest</code>
    </li>
    <li>
       A manifest for this origin is already cached at the user agent.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is already a pending manifest request for the origin.
    </li>
  </ol>

  Once EPR has been enabled for an origin due to the presence of EPR: 1 on
  a response, EPR is effectively enabled for all resources from this origin,
  persistently, even if these resources do not specify an EPR header.  To
  disable EPR, an origin must send an EPR: 0 header.  The EPR: 0 header is
  also persistent.

  To <a>process response</a> <var>response</var>, execute the following steps:

  <ol>
    <li>
      If <var>response</var>'s <a for="response">URL</a> is <a><i lang="la">a

    </li>
    <li>
      If <var>response</var>'s <a for="response">header list</a> contains a
      <a>header</a> named <code><a>EPR</a></code>, then:
