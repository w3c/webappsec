Abstract:
  This specification defines an API for specifying privacy and
  integrity policies on data, in the form of origin labels, and a
  mechanism for confining code according to such policies.  This
  allows Web application authors and server operators to shared data
  with untrusted&mdash;buggy but not malicious&mdash;code (e.g., in a mashup
  scenario) yet impose restrictions on how the code can share the data
  further.

<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Modern Web applications are conglomerations of JavaScript written by
  multiple authors. Authors routinely incorporate third-party scripts
  into their applications and share user data with third-party
  services (e.g., as part of a <em>mashup</em>).  Unfortunately, in
  the existing model, the user's data confidentiality and integrity is
  put at risk when one incorporates untrusted third-party code or
  shares data with untrusted third-party services.

  Mechanisms such as CORS and CSP can be used to mitigate these risks
  by giving authors control over whom they share data with. But, once
  data is shared, these mechanisms do not impose any restrictions on
  how the code that was granted access can further disseminate the
  data.

  This document specifies an extension to the current model called
  Confinement with Origin Web Labels (COWL). COWL provides authors
  with APIs for specifying (mandatory) access control policies on
  data, including content, in terms of <a>origin labels</a>.  These
  policies are enforced in a mandatory fashion, transitively, even
  once code has access to the data.  For example, with COWL, the
  author of <code>https://example.com</code> can specify that a
  password is confidential to <code>https://example.com</code> (and
  thus should only be disclosed to <code>https://example.com</code>)
  before sharing it with a third-party password strength checking
  service. In turn, COWL ensures that the third-party service, which
  necessarily computes on the sensitive password, is confined and
  respects the policy on the password: COWL disallows it from
  disclosing the password to any <a>origin</a> other than
  <code>https://example.com</code>.

  COWL enforces such policies by confining code at the
  <a>context</a>-level, according to the sensitivity (i.e., the label)
  of the data the code has observed. To reap the greatest benefits of
  COWL, authors will need to compartmentalize applications into
  multiple contexts (e.g., <a>iframes</a>).

  In the existing model, any page served from an origin has the
  ambient, implicit authority of that origin.  This documents
  generalizes this notion of authority and gives authors explicit
  control over it with <a>privileges</a>.  For example, by default, a
  page whose origin is <code>https://example.com</code> has the
  privilege for <code>https://example.com</code>. This gives the page
  the authority to arbitrarily disseminate data sensitive to
  <code>https://example.com</code>; to be backwards-compatible,
  the page is not confined when reading data sensitive to
  <code>https://example.com</code>.  However, COWL allows the author
  to run the page with "weaker" <a>delegated privileges</a> (e.g., one
  corresponding the current user at <code>https://example.com</code>)
  or to drop the privilege altogether.

  COWL is intended to be used as a defense-in-depth mechanism that can
  restrict how untrusted&mdash;buggy but not malicious&mdash;code
  handles sensitive data. Given the complexities of browser
  implementations and presence of covert channels, malicious code may
  be able to exfiltrate data. Authors should still use discretionary
  access control mechanisms, such as CSP and CORS, to restrict access
  to the data in the first place.

  <section>
  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  The goal of COWL is to provide authors with a means for protecting
  the confidentiality and integrity of data that is shared with
  untrusted, whether third-party or their own, code.  Existing
  mechanisms (e.g.,
  CORS'sk<a><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code></a> header and
  the <a>postMessage()</a> <code>targetOrigin</code> argument) provide
  a way for restricting which <a>origins</a> may access the shared data.
  But, once content has access to data it can usually disseminate it
  without restrictions.  While CSP can be used to confine code, i.e.,
  restrict how confidential data is disseminated, setting a correct
  CSP policy (as to confine code) is difficult and limited to content
  the author has control over. Indeed, sharing confidential data in
  the existing model almost always requires the sender to trust the
  receiver not to leak the data, accidentally or otherwise.  COWL
  provides a defense-in-depth option for protecting data
  confidentiality and integrity.  In particular, with COWL:

  1. Authors should be able to specify confidentiality and integrity
     policies on data in terms of origin labels: the origins to whom the
     data is confidential and the origins that endorse the data.  This
     allows authors to share sensitive data with third-party content and
     impose restrictions on the origins with which it can communicate
     once it inspects the sensitive data. Dually, it allows authors to
     share data via intermediate content while retaining its integrity.

  2. Authors should be able to run code with <em>least privilege</em>
     by restricting the origins the code can communicate with and thus
     how it can disseminate sensitive data.

  3. Authors should be able to <em>privilege separate</em>
     applications by compartmentalizing them into separate contexts that
     have <a>delegated privileges</a>.

  <h3 id="examples">Use Cases/Examples</h3>
  <h4 id="examples-checker">Confining untrusted third-party services</h4>

  An author wishes to use a service, loaded in the form of an iframe,
  without trusting it (or its dependencies) to not leak her
  sensitive data. To protect the data, the author associates a
  confidentiality <a>label</a> with the data, specifying the origins
  allowed to read the data.  The author then shares the newly created
  <a>labeled object</a> with the untrusted code.  In turn, COWL
  confines the untrusted code once it inspects the sensitive data, as
  to ensure that it can only communicate according to the
  author-specified policy (the label).

  <div class="example">
    The author of <code>https://example.com</code>
    wishes to use a third-party password strength checker provided by
    <code>https://untrusted.com</code>.  To protect the
    confidentiality of the password, the
    <code>https://example.com</code> application can use COWL to
    associate a confidentiality policy, in the form of a <a>label</a>,
    with the password before sending it to the untrusted service:

    <pre><code>
    // Create new policy using <a interface>Label</a>s that specifies that the password is sensitive
    // to https://example.com and should only be disclosed to this origin:
    var policy = new <a interface>Label</a>(window.location.origin);

    // Associate the label with the password:
    var labeledPassword = new <a interface>LabeledObject</a>(password, {confidentiality: policy});

    // Send the labeled password to the checker iframe:
    checker.postMessage(labeledPassword, "https://untrusted.com");

    // Register listener to receive a response from checker, etc.
    </code></pre>

    Once the checker inspects the <a>protected object</a>, i.e., the
    password, COWL limits the iframe to communicating with origins
    that preserve the password's confidentiality (in this case,
    <code>https://example.com</code>).  This policy is
    enforced mandatorily, even if the
    <code>https://untrusted.com</code> iframe sends the password to
    yet another iframe.

    Note, until the checker actually inspects the labeled password, it
    can freely communicate with any origins, e.g., with
    <code>https://untrusted.com</code>.  This is important since the
    checker may need to fetch resources (e.g., regular expressions) to
    check the password strength.  This is also safe&mdash;the checker has
    not inspected the sensitive password, and thus need not be
    confined.
  </div>

  Other use cases in this category include password managers and
  encrypted document editors, for example, where an
  encryption/decryption layer and a storage layer are provided by
  distrusting, but not malicious, services.  The academic paper on
  COWL describes these use cases in detail [[COWL-OSDI]].

  <h4 id="examples-mashup">Sharing data with third-party mashups</h4>

  A server operator wishes to provide third-party mashups access to
  user data. In addition to using CORS response headers to restrict the
  <a>origins</a> that can access the data [[!CORS]], the operator
  wishes to restrict how the data is further disseminated by these
  origins. To do so, the operator sends a response header
  field named <a href="#response-header"><code>Sec-COWL</code></a>
  (described in [[#response-header]]) whose value contains the
  sensitivity of the data in the form of a serialized confidentiality
  <a>label</a>.  In turn, COWL enforces the label restrictions on the
  third-party code.

  <div class="example">
    The server operator of <code>https://provider.com</code> uses a
    CORS response header to grant <code>https://mashup.com</code>
    access to a resource. The operator also sets a COWL header to
    specify that the resource is confidential to
    <code>https://provider.com</code> and should not be disseminated
    arbitrarily:

    <pre><code>
     <a>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: https://mashup.com
     <a href="#response-header">Sec-COWL</a>: <a>data-confidentiality</a> [ ["https://provider.com"] ]
    </code></pre>

    COWL only allows a <code>https://mashup.com</code> context to read
    the sensitive response if the label restrictions of the response
    are respected, i.e., if the code can only communicate with
    <code>https://provider.com</code>.

    Note, COWL only allows the code to inspect the response if the
    <a>context labels</a>, which dictate the context's ability to
    communicate, are more
    restricting than the labels of the response. A more permissive
    approach, which does not require the context give up its ability
    to communicate arbitrarily is to use <a>labeled JSON response</a>.
    The <a href="#mashup-example-xhr">mashup XHR example</a> shows how
    authors can accomplish this.
  </div>

  <h4 id="examples-isolation">Content isolation via privilege separation</h4>

  A server operator wishes to isolate content (e.g., of different
  users) while serving it from a single physical <a>origin</a>.  The
  operator can leverage <a>privileges</a> to ensure that content of
  one part of the site has different authority from another and,
  importantly, does not have authority of the physical origin.
  Concretely, when serving content, the operator can set the
  content's <a>context privilege</a> to a weaker, <a>delegated
  privilege</a>. This ensures that the content are privilege
  separated.

  <div class="example">
    Suppose <code>https://university.edu</code> wished to isolate
    different parts of their site according to users. The server
    operator can weaken the privilege of a page when serving user
    content by providing a response header field named
    <a href="#response-header"><code>Sec-COWL</code></a>
    (see [[#response-header]]) whose value contains
    a serialized <a>delegated privilege</a>. For example, for any
    content under <code>https://university.edu/~user1</code>, the
    following header is set:

    <pre><code>
     <a href="#response-header">Sec-COWL</a>: <a>ctx-privilege</a> [ ['self', 'cowl://user1'] ]
    </code></pre>

    Having this privilege can be understood as having the authority of
    <code>user1</code>'s part of the
    <code>https://university.edu</code> origin.  COWL ensures that the
    content of this user cannot interfere with the content of
    <code>https://university.edu</code> or another user
    e.g.,  <code>user2</code>.  For example, the content cannot modify
    <code>https://university.edu</code> cookies or the DOM of another
    <code>http://university.edu</code> page.

    This <a>delegated privilege</a> also ensures that the
    content cannot disseminate data sensitive to another user (e.g.,
    <code>user2</code>) arbitrarily&mdash; without being confined,
    it can only disseminate <code>user1</code>'s data on
    <code>http://university.edu</code>.
    Of course, this requires the server operator to label
    sensitive data (e.g., when sending it to the user agent) appropriately
    (e.g., <code>user2</code>'s data is labeled
    <code><a>Label</a>("https://university.edu")._or("user2")</code>).

    The <a  href="#university-example-js">sub-origin isolation in
    JavaScript</a> shows how this example can be implemented using the
    COWL JavaScript APIs.
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    Note, sub-domains should be used when possible to ensure that
    content is isolated using the Same-Origin Policy. But, even in
    such cases, COWL can provide a useful layer of defense.
  </div>

  <h4 id="examples-leastpriv">Running content with least-privileges</h4>

  An author wishes to use a library that is tightly coupled with the
  page (e.g., jQuery), but not trust it to protect the user's
  confidentiality and integrity. With COWL, the author can do this by
  loading the untrusted library after <a>dropping privileges</a> (from
  the context's <a>default privilege</a>).  In doing so, the content
  (and thus the library) loses its implicit authority over the
  content's origin.

  <div class="example">
    The author of <code>https://example.com</code> can drop privileges
    in JavaScript:

    <pre><code>
    // Drop privileges, by setting the <a>context privilege</a> to an <a>empty privilege</a>:
    COWL.privilege = new <a>Privilege()</a>;

    // Load untrusted library
    </code></pre>

    Or, by setting the content's initial privilege to the <a>empty
      privilege</a> using
    <a href="#response-header"><code>Sec-COWL</code></a> response header:

    <pre><code>
     <a href="#response-header">Sec-COWL</a>: <a>ctx-privilege</a> [ [] ]
    </code></pre>

    <div class="note">
      Note, while this ensures that the context code cannot, for instance,
      access the origin's cookies, the author must still associate a
      confidentiality label with resources (e.g., HTTP responses) to
      ensure that data is properly protected.
    </div>
  </div>

  In some cases it is useful for a particular context to have the
  privilege to disseminate certain category of data.  (The
  <code>or</code> part of <a>labels</a> can be used to easily
  categorize differently-sensitive data.) To this end, the author
  should run the context with a <a>delegated privilege</a> instead of
  the <a>empty privilege</a>. The above [[#examples-isolation]] shows
  one such example.
  </section>

  <section>
  <h3 id="trust-model">Trust Model</h3>
    COWL provides developers with a way of imposing restrictions on
    how untrusted code can disseminate sensitive data.  However,
    authors should avoid sharing sensitive data with malicious code,
    since such code may be able to exploit covert channels, which are
    present in most browsers, to leak the data.  COWL can only prevent
    information leakage from code that (e.g., is buggy and) uses overt
    communication channels.

    Similarly, COWL provides no guarantees against attacks wherein
    users are manipulated into leaking sensitive data via out-of-band
    channels.  For example, an attacker may be able to convince a
    user to navigate their user agent to an attacker-owned origin by
    entering a URL that contains sensitive information into the user
    agent's address bar.

    <div class="note">
      COWL should always be used as an additional layer of defense to
      other security mechanisms such as CSP, SRI, CORS, and iframe
      <code><a element-attr>sandbox</a></code>.

  <h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts and Terminology</h2>

  <h3 id="key-concepts-labels">Labels</h3>
  1.  An <dfn>origin label</dfn>, or more succinctly a
      <dfn>label</dfn>, encodes either a confidentiality or integrity
      security policy as conjunctive normal form (AND's and OR's)
      formulae over <a>origin</a>s.  Labels can be associated with
      <a>contexts</a> or with <a>structurally clonable</a> objects.

      When associated with a <a>context</a>, the label restricts the
      origins that the context can communicate with, as detailed in
      [[#framework-context-labels]].

      <div class="example">
        The confidentiality label
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")._or("https://b.com")</code>,
        when associated with a context,
        restricts the context to sending data to
        <code>https://a.com</code> or <code>https://b.com</code>, but
        no other origins.
        This context label reflects the fact the context may contain data
        that is sensitive to either <code>https://a.com</code> or
        <code>https://b.com</code>; it is thus only safe for it to
        communicate <em>to</em> these origins.

        Note, because the context can communicate data to either origin,
        another context associated with the more restricting
        label <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code> cannot
        send it data. Doing so would allow for data confidential
        to <code>https://a.com</code> to be leaked to <code>https://b.com</code>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        The integrity label
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com").or("https://b.com")</code>,
        when associated with a context, restricts the context to
        receiving data from (a context or server) that is at least as
        trustworthy as <code>https://a.com</code> or
        <code>https://b.com</code>.  This context label ensures that
        the code running in the context can only be influenced by data
        which either <code>https://a.com</code> or
        <code>https://b.com</code> endorse.
      </div>

      When associated with an object, a confidentiality label
      specifies the origins to whom the object is sensitive, while an
      integrity label specifies the origins that endorse the object.
      Objects that have labels associated with them are called
      <dfn>labeled objects</dfn>.  [[#object-labels]] defines how
      labels are associated with objects.

      <div class="example">
        Consider an <code>https://example.com</code> page that
        receives a labeled object (e.g., via <a>postMessage()</a>)
        with the following labels:

        * Confidentiality:
          <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code>.
          This label indicates that the object is sensitive to
          <code>https://example.com</code>.

        * Integrity:
          <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>.  This
          label indicates that the object has been endorsed by
          <code>https://a.com</code>. If
          <code>https://example.com</code> received the message from an
          intermediary <code>https://b.com</code> context, this label
          reflects the fact that the object (produced by
          <code>https://a.com</code>) was not tampered.
      </div>

  2.  Mathematically, a label is a <em>conjunctive normal form</em>
      formula over origins [[DCLabels]].

      A label is in <dfn>normal form</dfn> if reducing it according to
      the <a>label normal form reduction</a> algorithm produces the
      same value.

      Two labels are <dfn>equivalent</dfn> if their <a>normal form</a>
      values are mathematically equal.

      A label <var>A</var> <dfn>subsumes</dfn> (or is more
      <dfn>restricting</dfn> than) another label
      <var>B</var> if the result of running the <a>label subsumption</a>
      algorithm on the <a>normal form</a>s of <var>A</var> and
      <var>B</var> returns <code>true</code>. Labels are partially
      ordered according to this subsumes relation.

      The <dfn>current confidentiality label</dfn> is the
      confidentiality label associated with the current context.
      [[#framework-context-labels]] specifies how labels are associated with
      contexts.

      The <dfn>current integrity label</dfn> is the
      integrity label associated with the current context.
      [[#framework-context-labels]] specifies how labels are associated with
      contexts.

      When reading a <a>labeled object</a>, a context gets
      <dfn>tainted</dfn>, i.e., its <a>context labels</a> are updated by
      invoking <a>context tainting</a> algorithm, to reflect that it
      has read sensitive (of potentially different trustworthiness)
      data and should be confined accordingly.

  <h3 id="key-concepts-privileges">Privileges</h3>
  1.  A <dfn>privilege</dfn> is an unforgeable object that corresponds
      to a <a>label</a>. Privileges are associated with contexts and
      reflect their authority.

      Privileges can be used to bypass confinement restrictions
      imposed by confidentiality labels.  In particular, a privilege
      can be used to bypass the restrictions imposed by any label
      its corresponding label&mdash;the
      <a>internal privilege label</a>&mdash;subsumes.

      <div class="example">
        Consider a context from <code>https://a.com</code> whose
        <a>current confidentiality label</a> is <code><a
        interface>Label</a>("https://a.com").and("https://b.com")</code>.
        This label confines the context to only communicating with
        entities whose labels are at least as restricting as this
        label. For example, it restricts the context from
        communicating with a context labeled <code><a
        interface>Label</a>("https://b.com")</code>, since doing
        so could leak <code>https://a.com</code> data to
        <code>https://b.com</code>. It similarly prevents the context
        from communicating with <code>https://a.com</code>.

        But, suppose that the context's <a>current privilege</a>
        corresponds to <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>
        (afterall, the context originated from <code>https://a.com</code>).
        Then, the context would be able to bypass some of the
        restrictions imposed by the context label.  Specifically, the
        context would be able to communicate with
        <code>https://b.com</code>; the privilege confers it the right
        to declassify <code>https://a.com</code> data to
        <code>https://b.com</code>. Indeed, when taking this privilege
        into consideration, the <a>effective confidentiality label</a>
        of the context is <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://b.com")</code>.

        Note, the privilege does not allow the context to bypass any
        label restrictions. For example, it does not allow the context
        to communicate with <code>https://a.com</code> since doing so
        could leak <code>https://b.com</code> data.

        <div class="note">
          To be flexible, COWL uses the context privilege to remove
          certain restrictions imposed by the <a>context label</a>.
          To avoid accidentally leaking sensitive context data,
          authors should use <a interface>LabeledObject</a>s.
        </div>

      </div>

      Privileges can also be used to bypass integrity restrictions
      imposed by integrity labels. In particular, a privilege can be
      used to endorse an otherwise untrustworthy labeled
      <a>context</a> (or <a>labeled object</a>) as to allow it to
      communicate with more trustworthy end-points (another context or
      server).

      <div class="example">
        Consider an <code>https://a.com</code> context whose
        <a>current integrity label</a> is
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")._or("https://b.com")</code>.
        This label confines the context to only communicating with
        entities that are at most as trustworthy as this
        label. For example, it restricts the context from
        communicating with a context whose <a>current integrity
        label</a> is
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>, since doing
        so would potentially corrupt <code>https://a.com</code> data
        (e.g., by allowing <code>https://b.com</code> to influence the
        computation).

        But, if the context's <a>current privilege</a> corresponds
        to <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>, the
        context would be able to bypass some of these integrity restrictions.
        Specifically, the context would be able to communicate with the
        more-trustworthy context (labeled
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>) since the
        privilege confers it the right to endorse (or vouch for) its
        context on behalf of <code>https://a.com</code>. Indeed, when
        taking privileges into account, the <a>effective integrity
        label</a> of the context is <code><a
        interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>.

        Note, the privilege cannot be used to bypass any integrity
        restrictions.  For example, it does not allow the context to
        communicate with a context whose integrity label is <code><a
        interface>Label</a>(https://b.com)</code>.
      </div>

      Note, <a>browsing contexts</a> have a <a>current privilege</a>
      that, by default, corresponds to the origin of the context, as
      described in [[#framework-context-labels]]. But, authors should set the <a>current
      privilege</a> to a <a>delegated privilege</a> to follow
      the principle of least privilege.

  2.  The <dfn>current privilege</dfn> is the privilege associated
      with the current context. [[#framework-context-labels]] specifies how
      privileges are associated with contexts.

  3.  The <dfn>effective confidentiality label</dfn> is the label
      returned by the <a>label downgrade</a> algorithm when invoked
      with the <a>current confidentiality label</a> and <a>current
      privilege</a>.

  4.  The <dfn>effective integrity label</dfn> is the label
      returned by the <a>label upgrade</a> algorithm when invoked
      with the <a>current integrity label</a> and <a>current
      privilege</a>.

  5.  Code can take <dfn>ownership</dfn> of a <a>privilege</a>
      <var>priv</var> by setting the <a>current privilege</a> to the
      privilege produced via the <a>combination</a> of the <a>current
        privilege</a> and <var>priv</var>. In doing so, it is said
      that the context <dfn>owns</dfn> the privilege.

  <h3 id="framework-labels">Labels</h3>

    Each <a>label</a> is an immutable object represented by a
    <a interface>Label</a> object, the interface of which is defined in
    this section.

    A <a interface>Label</a> MUST have an internal <dfn>label set</dfn>, which is
    a non-empty set of <a>disjunction set</a>s.

    A <dfn>disjunction set</dfn> is a set of <a>origin</a>
    <a>URL</a>s.

    A label is said to be an <dfn>empty label</dfn> if its <a>label
      set</a> contains a single, empty <a>disjunction set</a>.

  <h3 id="privileges">Privileges</h3>

    Each <a>privilege</a> is an immutable object represented by a <a
    interface>Privilege</a> object, the interface of which is
    defined in this section.

    A <a interface>Privilege</a> MUST have an <dfn>internal privilege
    label</dfn>.

    The <dfn>combination</dfn> of privileges <var>A</var> and
    <var>B</var> is a privilege produced by invoking the
    <a>combine()</a> method on <var>A</var> (respectively,
    <var>B</var>) with <var>B</var> (respectively, <var>A</var>) as an
    argument.

    A privilege is said to be an <dfn>empty privilege</dfn> if its
    <a>internal privilege label</a> is the <a>empty label</a>. A
    context is said to be <dfn>unprivileged</dfn> if its context
    privilege is the <a>empty privilege</a>.  By setting the
    <a>context privilege</a> to the <a>empty privilege</a>, a context
    is said to be <dfn>dropping privileges</dfn>.

    A privilege <var>P1</var> is said to be a <dfn>delegated
    privilege</dfn> of <var>P2</var> if <var>P2</var>'s <a>internal
    privilege label</a> <a>subsumes</a> <var>P1</var>'s <a>internal
    privilege label</a>.

    <h4 id="privilege-examples">Examples</h4>

    <div class="example">
      To be backwards-compatible with the Same-Origin Policy, COWL
      grants each <a>browsing context</a> a <a>default privilege</a>
      that corresponds to their origin. For example, a page on
      <code>https://example.com</code> has a privilege whose <a>internal
      privilege label</a> is
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code>.

      As a result, reading data that is sensitive to
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code> does
      not confine the context. For example, reading a
      <a>labeled object</a> whose confidentiality label is
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code> does
      not restrict the context from communicating&mdash;and thus
      accidentally leak that object's contents&mdash;to another origin.
      To prevent accidental leaks, the author should drop privileges by
      setting the <a>current privilege</a> to an <a>empty
      privilege</a>:
      <pre><code>
        // Save privilege in case we need it later:
        var __savedPriv = COWL.privilege;

        // Drop privilege (set the <a>context privilege</a> to the <a>empty privilege</a>):
        COWL.privilege = new <a>Privilege</a>();
      </code></pre>

      After this point, if the context reads data with a
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code>
      confidentiality label, COWL will restrict it to communicating
      with <code>https://example.com</code>.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      Consider an extension to the password strength checker example of
      [[#examples-checker]] that uses <a>FreshPrivilege()</a>s to
      ensure that the untrusted checker cannot communicate with any
      entity other than the parent context.
      <pre><code>
        // Create new fresh privilege:
        var priv = new <a>FreshPrivilege()</a>;

        // Take <a>ownership</a> of the fresh privilege:
        COWL.privilege = COWL.privilege.combine(priv);

        // Associate the unique label with the password:
        var labeledPassword = new <a interface>LabeledObject</a>(password, {confidentiality: priv.asLabel()});

        // Send the labeled password to the checker iframe:
        checker.postMessage(labeledPassword, "https://untrusted.com");
      </code></pre>
      Once the <code>https://untrusted.com</code> context reads the
      password it will be <a>tainted</a> by the unique, <a>internal
      privilege label</a> of <code>priv</code>; the unique origin
      ensures that it cannot send the password to, for example, public
      parts of <code>https://example.com</code>. Indeed, only the
      owner of <code>priv</code> can disseminate the labeled password
      (result) arbitrarily.
    </div>

    <div id="university-example-js" class="example">
      Consider an implementation of the content isolation example of
      [[#examples-isolation]] using the COWL JavaScript API.
      In this example, the author <code>https://university.edu</code> isolates
      different parts of their site according to
      users. For <code>user1</code> it can do this as follows:

      <pre><code>
        // Create a label corresponding to the university origin:
        var uni = new <a interface>Label</a>(window.location.origin);
        // Create a new label that corresponds to user1's data on university.edu:
        var user1 = uni._or("cowl://user1"); // Here the cowl:// is an arbitrary <a>scheme</a>

        // Originally, COWL.privilege.asLabel().equals(uni).
        // Drop the current <a>context privilege</a> to a delegated privilege:
        COWL.privilege = COWL.privilege.delegate(user1);
      </code></pre>

      At this point, the context can only arbitrarily disseminate data
      that is labeled
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://university.edu")._or("cowl://user1")</code>;
      it cannot disseminate data that is
      sensitive to the university (e.g., which is labeled
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://university.edu")</code>)
      or to another user (e.g., <code>user2</code>'s data is
      labeled
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://university.edu")._or("cowl://user2")</code>).

  <h3 id="framework-context-labels">Labeled Contexts</h3>

    COWL extends <a>browsing contexts</a> and <a>Workers</a> with a
    <dfn>COWL state</dfn>, which is used to restrict the context's
    communication channels. In this document, the term
    <dfn>context</dfn> is used to refer to both <a>browsing
    contexts</a> and <a>Workers</a>. The COWL state consists of:

    * The <dfn>confinement mode</dfn> status, which indicates whether
      or not COWL confinement is enabled and thus <a>labels</a> should
      be enforced in the current context.

    * The <dfn>context <a>labels</a></dfn>, which consist consist of:

      * <dfn>context confidentiality label</dfn> reflects the
        sensitivity of the data that the context has read.

      * <dfn>context integrity label</dfn> reflects the integrity of
        the data that the context has read.

    * The <dfn>context <a>privilege</a></dfn>, which encodes the context's
      ability to bypass the restrictions of certain labels.

    Each context's <a>COWL state</a> MUST be initially set to the
    <dfn>default COWL state</dfn>, where:

    * The <a>confinement mode</a> is disabled.

    * The <a>context confidentiality label</a> is set to the
      <dfn>default confidentiality label</dfn>: <a>empty label</a>.

    * The <a>context integrity label</a> is set to the
      <dfn>default integrity label</dfn>: <a>empty label</a>.

    * The <a>context privilege</a> is set to the
      <dfn>default privilege</dfn>: a
      <a>privilege</a> whose <a>internal privilege label</a> is
      equivalent to <a>Label(<var>origin</var>)</a></code>, where
      <var>origin</var> is the string representation of the context or
      Worker's <a>origin</a>.

    <div class="note">
      The <a>default COWL state</a> is backwards-compatible with the
      existing Web model. Specifically:

      * Unless <a>confinement mode</a> is enabled, a context is not
        subject to confinement.

      * Unless the <a>current confidentiality label</a>
        and the <a>current integrity label</a> are
        non-<a>empty label</a>s, the context's communication
        is unrestricted; code is only
        subject to the restrictions imposed by other mechanism such as
        the Same-Origin Policy and CSP.

      * Unless the <a>current privilege</a> is dropped or set to a
        <a>delegated privilege</a>, code can disseminate data sensitive
        to the browsing context's <a>origin</a>, even when <a>confinement
        mode</a> is enabled.  Such data is implicitly <em>declassified</em>
        using the <a>context privilege</a>. Authors should send
        <a interface>LabeledObject</a>s to explicitly communicate the
        sensitivity (and integrity) of the data they are sharing.

    A <a interface>LabeledObject</a> interface represents an immutable

    arguments).

    A <a interface>LabeledObject</a> MUST have an internal <dfn>protected

      are mainly useful for sending sensitive data to an untrusted
      context, e.g., via <a>cross-document messaging</a>, as a way to ensure
      that the data's confidentiality and integrity (as specified by
      the labels) are respected by the untrusted context. Hence, the
      <a>LabeledObject()</a> constructor only accepts objects that can
      be <a>structurally cloned</a>.

    <div class="note">
      Note: the labels of a <a interface>LabeledObject</a> are

      However, to inspect the internal, <a>protected object</a>, the
      current context must be <a>tainted</a> according to the object's
      labels. This ensures two things:

      * The context can't violate the confidentiality of the data (as
        specified by the confidentiality label) by communicating
        arbitrarily once it reads data labeled as such.

      * The context can't violate the integrity of entities more
        trustworthy than the data. (The trustworthiness of the data is
        specified by the integrity label.) In particular, once the
        context reads the data and gets <a>tainted</a>, the rest of the
        computation is restricted to writing to entities that are at
        most as trustworthy as the data, since the read data may have

      0. Let <var>obj</var> be the <a>protected object</a> of the

         returns <code>false</code>, the method
         MUST throw a <code>SecurityError</code> exception and
         terminate this algorithm.

         Note, these checks ensure that the new labels of the object are
         at least as restricting as the original labels, taking into
         consideration the privileges of the context.

      7. Else, return a new <a interface>LabeledObject</a>, with the

    <h4 id="labeledobject-examples">Examples</h4>
    Below are several examples showing the usage of <a
    interface>LabeledObject</a>s.  [[#examples-checker]] gives an
    example of how <a interface>LabeledObject</a>s can be used to
    confine third-party libraries (e.g., a password strength
    checker). [[#labeledobject-xhr-send-example]] and
    [[#labeledobject-xhr-receive-example]] show how <a
    interface>LabeledObject</a>s are used with the
    <a>XMLHttpRequest</a> constructor.

    <div class="example">
      Author of <code>https://police.gov</code> wishes to plot the
      location of police cars on a map provided by
      <code>https://maps.biz</code> without revealing the individual
      car locations. After revealing the general area to
      <code>https://maps.biz</code>, the author of
      <code>https://police.gov</code> labels the police car
      coordinates and sends them to the mapping service:

      <pre><code>

        // Fetch map for provided location and draw it
        mapsIframe.postMessage({ cmd: 'draw', location: ... }, mapsOrigin);

        var locations = ... // Array of police-car coordinates

        // Label the locations:
        var labeledLocations = new <a interface>LabeledObject</a>(locations,
                                     { confidentiality: new <a interface>Label</a>(window.location.origin) });

        // Send the labeled locations and plot them
        mapsIframe.postMessage({ cmd: 'plot', locations: labeledLocations }, mapsOrigin);
      </code></pre>
      When receiving a <code>draw</code> message, the author of
      <code>https://maps.biz</code> navigates the iframe map (a nested
      context) to draw the map; otherwise, it simply forwards messages
      from the parent (e.g., <code>plot</code>, <code>zoom</code>, and
      <code>move</code>). (This design ensures that only the innermost
      iframe gets tainted.)

      The innermost map iframe registers a handler, that, for example,
      draws cars on top of map tiles:
      <pre><code>
      window.addEventListener("message", function (event) {
        switch (event.data.cmd) {
          case 'plot':
            var coordinates = event.data.locations.<a attribute>protectedObject</a>;
            coordinates.forEach(function (coordinate) {
              // add car to map at coordinate
            });
          case 'zoom': ...
          case 'move': ...
          ...
        };
      }, false);
      </pre></code>

      Note that before getting the first <a attribute>protectedObject</a>, the iframe
      can communicate arbitrarily, e.g., to fetch map tiles. But once
      it inspects the confidential locations COWL confines the
      code&mdash;it restricts it to only communicating with
      <code>https://police.gov</code>. Importantly, it can keep
      receiving messages from its parent context via
      <a>postMessage()</a> to, for instance, move a car.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      The author of <code>https://example.com</code> wishes to ensure
      that a particular JSON object conforms to a set of validation
      filters before submitting it to a remote server.  (Consider, for
      example, a form validator that checks if an email address is
      valid.) To this end, it labels the JSON and sends the <a>labeled
      object</a> to (e.g., a Worker or iframe) that performs the
      validation.

      The validation author inspects the object, but only endorses it
      if it conforms to the spec:
      <pre><code>
      function handler(lObj) {
        if (validateA(lObj.<a attribute>protectedObject</a>)) {
          var origin = ... ; // current origin (e.g., window.location.origin)
          var endorsement = new <a interface>Label</a>(origin)._or('cowl://validate-A');
          // Return a clone of the labeled object that is additionally
          // endorsed by the current (sub-)origin.
          return lObj.clone({ integrity: lObj.integrity.and(endorsement) });
        } else {
          return null;
        }
      }
      </code></pre>
      The author of <code>https://example.com</code> can then pass the
      endorsed object to other validators or end-point (e.g., a
      server), who can, in turn, further endorse the object or verify
      the origins that have endorsed it.

    <h3 id="header">The <code>Sec-COWL</code> HTTP Headers</h3>

    The <code>Sec-COWL</code> HTTP request and response headers are
    used by user agents and servers to convey <a>label metadata</a> to
    servers and user agents, respectively.

    <dfn>Label metadata</dfn> is either <a>labeled context metadata</a>
    or <a>labeled data metadata</a>.

    <dfn>Labeled context metadata</dfn> encodes <a>COWL state</a>
    information, including:

    * the serialized <a>context confidentiality label</a> given by the <a>ctx-confidentiality</a> directive,
    * the serialized <a>context integrity label</a> given by the <a>ctx-integrity</a> directive, and
    * the serialized <a>context privilege</a>'s <a>internal privilege label</a> given by the <a>ctx-privilege</a> directive.

    Its ABNF is:

    <pre>
      <dfn>ctx-metadata</dfn>        = <a>ctx-directive</a> *( ";" [ <a>ctx-directive</a> ] )
      <dfn>ctx-directive</dfn>       = *<a>WSP</a> <a>ctx-directive-name</a> 1*<a>WSP</a> <a>label-set</a>
      <dfn>ctx-directive-name</dfn>  = "<dfn>ctx-confidentiality</dfn>" / "<dfn>ctx-integrity</dfn>" / "<dfn>ctx-privilege</dfn>"
    </pre>

    <dfn>Labeled data metadata</dfn> is used to convey the
    confidentiality and integrity labels of an HTTP request or response, using
    the <a>data-confidentiality</a> and
    <a>data-integrity</a> directives.  Its ABNF is:

    <pre>
      <dfn>data-metadata</dfn>       = <a>data-directive</a> *( ";" [ <a>data-directive</a> ] )
      <dfn>data-directive</dfn>      = *<a>WSP</a> <a>data-directive-name</a> 1*<a>WSP</a> <a>label-set</a>
      <dfn>data-directive-name</dfn> = "<dfn>data-confidentiality</dfn>" / "<dfn>data-integrity</dfn>"
    </pre>

    The ABNF for <dfn>serialized labels</dfn> is:

    <pre>
      <dfn>label-set</dfn>           = "[" <a>disjunction-set</a> *( "," [ <a>disjunction-set</a> ] ) "]" / <a>empty-label</a>
      <dfn>disjunction-set</dfn>     = "[" [ <a>source-expression</a> *( "," [ <a>source-expression</a> ] ) ] "]"
      <dfn>source-expression</dfn>   = "'self'" / <a>host-source</a>

      <h4 id="request-header">The <code>Sec-COWL</code> HTTP Request Header Field</h4>

      The ABNF for the <code>Sec-COWL</code> HTTP request header is:

      <pre>
        "Sec-COWL:" <a>ctx-metadata</a> / <a>data-metadata</a>
      </pre>

      The user agent MUST send a header field named <code>Sec-COWL</code>
      along with requests if <a>confinement mode</a> is enabled.
      The value of this header MUST contain the <a>labeled context
      metadata</a> of the context that performed the request. This
      <a>labeled context metadata</a> MUST include the current
      <a>context confidentiality label</a>, <a>context integrity
      label</a>, and <a>context privileges</a>. The user agent MAY
      send another header with this field name whose value is
      <a>labeled data metadata</a> (e.g., when sending <a>labeled
      objects</a> with <a>XMLHttpRequest</a>).


      <div class="example">
        Request header from a <code>http://a.com</code> page that has

      <h4 id="response-header">The <code>Sec-COWL</code> HTTP Response Header Field</h4>

      The ABNF for the <code>Sec-COWL</code> HTTP response header is:
      <pre>
        "Sec-COWL:" <a>ctx-metadata</a> / <a>data-metadata</a>
      </pre>

      The header value may contain <a>labeled context metadata</a>
      which can be used to set the initial <a>COWL state</a> of a
      context; or it may contain <a>labeled data metadata</a> which
      specifies the sensitivity of the response (which COWL then uses
      to determine whether or not to block the response).

      <div class="example">
        An author may wish to specify that the

    <h3 id="extension-xhr">Extensions to XMLHttpRequest</h3>

    The XMLHttpRequest specification SHOULD contain the
    modifications described below to enable the rest of this
    specification's work [[XHR]].

    <h4 id="sending-labeled-objects">Sending <a>labeled objects</a></h4>
    To allow authors to send <a>labeled objects</a> to a remote
    server, this specification extends the
    <a interface>XMLHttpRequest</a> interface with an overloaded
    <code><a>send()</a></code> method:

      <pre class="idl">
        partial interface XMLHttpRequest {
          void send(LabeledObject lobj);
        };
      </pre>
      The <dfn method title="XMLHttpRequest/send(lobj)"
      for="XMLHttpRequest">send(lobj)</dfn>  method MUST use an
      algorithm that is equivalent to the following:

      1. Let <var>obj</var> be the <a>protected object</a> of the
         <a argument for="XMLHttpRequest/send(lobj)">lobj</a> argument.

      2. Let <var>conf</var> be the confidentiality label of the <a
         argument for="XMLHttpRequest/send(lobj)">lobj</a> argument.

      3. Let <var>int</var> be the integrity label of the <a
         argument for="XMLHttpRequest/send(lobj)">lobj</a> argument.

      4. Let <var>privs</var> be the current <a>context privileges</a>.

      5. Let <var>remoteConf</var> be the <a>label</a>
         returned by the <a>Label(origin)</a> constructor
         called with the
         <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url">url</a>
         associated with the <a>request</a>.

      6. If <code><var>responseConf</var>.subsumes(<var>conf</var>,
         <var>privs</var>)</code> returns <code>false</code>, throw
         a <code>SecurityError</code> and terminate this algorithm.

         <div class="note">
           The user agent SHOULD warn the user that the script
           attempted to leak data to a remote server.
         </div>

      7. Let <var>json</var> be a new <a>JSON</a> object with the
         following entries:

         * <code>"confidentiality"</code> set to <var>conf</var>.<a>toJSON()</a>.
         * <code>"integrity"</code> set to <var>int</var>.<a>toJSON()</a></code>.
         * <code>"object"</code> set to <var>obj</var>.

      8. Set the <code>Content-Type</code> <a>header</a> to <code>`application/labeled-json`</code>.

      9. Append a header named <code>Sec-COWL</code> to the
         <a>author request headers</a> associated with the object this
         methods was called on.  The value of the
         <code>Sec-COWL</code> header MUST be <a>labeled data
         metadata</a> containing the confidentiality and integrity
         labels of the <a argument for="XMLHttpRequest/send(lobj)">lobj</a> argument.

      10. Invoke the <code><a>send()</a></code>
          method on the object this method was called on with
          <var>json</var> as an argument.

          Note, that <code><a>send()</a></code>
          throws an exception in step 4 if <var>obj</var> cannot be <a>serialized</a>.
          User agents MUST ensure that all <a>protected object</a>s can be
          serialized at the time of creating <a interface>LabeledObject</a>s.

          <div class="note">
            This algorithm does not check if the integrity label of
            the object subsumes the server's integrity label. It is
            the server's responsibility to ensure that untrustworthy
            data does not affect its computation in an unsafe way.
            Indeed, the only reason for checking the confidentiality
            labels is because the user agent has no way to ensure that
            the server will respect the confidentiality of the data.
          </div>

    <h5 id="labeledobject-xhr-send-example">Examples</h5>
    <div class="example">
      Author of <code>https://example.com</code> sends JSON object
      endorsed by <code>https://validator.com</code>:
      <pre><code>
      // Suppose that labeledObject is a public, high-integrity value:
      JSON.stringify(labeledObject.confidentiality) === '[[]]';
      JSON.stringify(labeledObject.integrity) === '[["https://validator.com"]]';

      // Create an XHR request:
      var req = new XMLHttpRequest()
      req.open("POST", "https://example.com/...");

      // Send the labeled object:
      req.send(labeledObject);
      </code></pre>
      Assuming the context has a <a>default COWL state</a>,
      <code><a>send()</a></code> would send an HTTP request of the form:

      <pre><code>
      Sec-COWL: <a>ctx-confidentiality</a> [[]];
                <a>ctx-integrity</a> [[]];

        "integrity": [["https://validator.com"]],
        "object": ...
      }
      </code></pre>
      The server can then verify the integrity label of the request
      and ensure that, if the user agent is conformant, the data was
      endorsed by <code>https://validator.com</code>.
    </div>

    <h4 id="receive-labeled-object">Receiving <a>labeled objects</a></h4>
    To allow authors to receive <a>labeled objects</a> from remote
    servers, the XMLHttpRequest specification SHOULD contain the
    following modifications [[XHR]]:

      1. The <code><a enum>XMLHttpRequestResponseType</a></code></h5>
         enumeration is extended with a new response type:

         <pre class="idl">
           enum <a href="https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#xmlhttprequestresponsetype">XMLHttpRequestResponseType</a> {
             // ... existing response types ...
             "labeled-json"
           };
         </pre>

      2. The <a href="https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#response-body">Response
        body</a> section of the specification is modified to add:

         1.  An <a interface>XMLHttpRequest</a> has associated
             <dfn>response <a interface>LabeledObject</a> object</dfn>.

         2. A <dfn>labeled JSON response</dfn> is the return value
            of these steps:

            1. If the <a>response LabeledObject object</a> is non-null, return it.

            2. If <a attribute>responseType</a> is not
               <code>"labeled-json"</code> or the <a>final MIME
               type</a> is not <code>application/labeled-json</code>, return null.

            3. Let <var>bytes</var> be the <a>response</a>'s <a>body</a>.

            3. If <var>bytes</var> is null, return null.

            4. Let <var>JSON text</var> be the result of running
               <a>utf-8 decode</a> on byte stream <var>bytes</var>.

            5. Let <var>JSON object</var> be the result of invoking the initial
               value of the <code>parse</code> property of the
               <code>JSON</code> object, with
               <var>JSON text</var> as its only argument. If that threw an
               exception, return null. [[!ECMA-262]]

            6. If the <var>JSON object</var> is missing any of
               the three entries: <code>"object"</code>,
               <code>"confidentiality"</code>, or
               <code>"integrity"</code> return null.

            7. Let <var>protected object</var> be the value of the <code>"object"</code> entry.

            8. Let <var>self</var> be the
                <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-response-url">url</a>
                associated with the <a>response</a>.

            9. Let <var>conf</var> be the <a>label</a>
               returned by calling the <a>fromJSON()</a> function with
               the <code>"confidentiality"</code> entry of the
               <var>JSON object</var> and <var>self</var>.  If the
               function threw an exception, return null.

            10. Let <var>int</var> be the <a>label</a>
                returned by calling the <a>fromJSON()</a> function
                with the <code>"integrity"</code> entry of the
                <var>JSON object</var> and <var>self</var>.  If the
                function threw an exception, return null.

            11. Let <var>responseInt</var> be the <a>label</a>
                returned by the <a>Label(origin)</a> constructor
                called with <var>self</var>.

            12. If <var>responseInt</var> does not subsume
                <var>int</var>, return null.

                ISSUE: Should the user agent warn the user if the
                server provided an integrity label that it is not
                allowed to provide?

            13. Set the <a>labeled JSON response</a> to a newly
                created <a interface>LabeledObject</a> whose
                <a>protected object</a> is <var>protected object</var>,
                confidentiality label is <var>conf</var>, and
                integrity label is <var>int</var>.

            14. Return the <a>labeled JSON response</a>.

      3. Modify the <a attribute>response</a> attribute by
         adding the following clause to step 2 of the
         <strong>↪ Otherwise</strong> clause:

         <strong>↪ If <a attribute>responseType</a> is</strong> <code>"labeled-json"</code>
         <p style="text-indent: 2.5em">Return the <a>labeled JSON response</a>.</p>

      4. Modify step 12 of the <a>open()</a> method by adding the
         following sub-step:

         * Set <a>response LabeledObject object</a> to null.

    <h5 id="labeledobject-xhr-receive-example">Examples</h5>
    <div class="example" id="mashup-example-xhr">
      [[#examples-mashup]] gives an example of a mashup scenario
      wherein the data provider uses the <a
      href="#response-header">Sec-COWL</a> HTTP response header to
      ensure that the mashup integrator can only read the HTTP
      response if it is sufficiently confined. A more permissive
      approach is to send a <a>labeled JSON response</a>.

      Specifically, the server operator of
      <code>https://provider.com</code> uses a CORS response header to
      send <code>https://mashup.com</code> a labeled JSON object. To
      ensure that the data is protected it sets the
      <code>Content-Type</code> response header value to
      <code>`application/labeled-json`</code> and sets the labels
      appropriately:

      <pre><code>
       <a>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: https://mashup.com
       Content-Type: application/labeled-json;

       {
         "confidentiality": [[]],
         "integrity": [["https://provider.com"]],
         "object": ...
       }
      </code></pre>

      The confidentiality label specifies that the object is
      confidential to <code>https://provider.com</code> and should
      not be disseminated arbitrarily.

      The author of <code>https://mashup.com</code> can read such
      labeled responses by simply setting the <a
      attribute>responseType</a> accordingly:
      <pre><code>

      // Create an XHR request to get the data:
      var req = new XMLHttpRequest()
      req.open("GET", "https://provider.com/apis/...");
      req.responseType = "labeled-json";
      req.onload = function (e) {
        var labeledObject = req.response; // is a <a interface>LabeledObject</a>

        // At this point, the context is still untainted, but:
        JSON.stringify(labeledObject.confidentiality) === '[[]]';
        JSON.stringify(labeledObject.integrity) === '[["https://provider.com"]]';
      };
      req.send();
      </code></pre>

      Here, COWL sets the <a attribute>response</a> to a new <a
      interface>LabeledObject</a>, but does not <a>taint</a> the
      context with the response label. Indeed the
      <code>https://mashup.com</code> integrator can perform many
      other requests to different origins. Only when the
      <a>protected objects</a> of these <a>labeled objects</a> are
      used will COWL taint the context and impose the label
      restrictions.
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      An image provider can serve "read-once" images by labeling them
      with a unique origin when reply to an HTTP request:
      <pre><code>
       <a>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: *
       Content-Type: application/labeled-json;

       {
         "confidentiality": [["'unique'"]],
         "integrity": [[]],
         "object": ... base64-encoded image ...
       }
      </code></pre>
      Once the receiver inspects the <a attribute>protectedObject</a>
      of the response, COWL <a>taint</a>s the context and ensures that
      it cannot communicate with anybody.

      <h3 id="enforcement">Confinement Enforcement</h3>

        <em>This sub-section is non-normative</em>

        To enforce confinement, COWL ensures that code in a
        <a>context</a> cannot send data (e.g., via <a>cross-document
        messaging</a> or by performing a <a>fetch</a>) to contexts or
        servers that do not preserve the confidentiality of the data.
        Similarly, COWL ensures that a context cannot receive data from a
        context or server that is less trustworthy.

                Note, if the receiver has not enabled <a>confinement

          <h4 id="modifications-to-html5">Modifications to HTML5</h4>

          When <a>confinement mode</a> is enabled the user agent MUST
          ensure that content cannot access other content from the
          same origin (e.g., using an iframe's
          <code><a element-attr>contentDocument</a></code>) that would violate
          label restrictions. Specifically, if a <a>browsing
            context</a>'s <a>confinement mode</a> is enabled
          the user agent MUST set the following flags
          of the context's <a>active sandboxing flag set</a>:


          * The <a>sandboxed plugins browsing context flag</a>.

          * The <a>sandboxed <code>document.domain</code> browsing context flag</a>.

          If the context's <a>effective confidentiality label</a> or
          integrity label are not the <a>empty label</a>, the
          user agent MUST additionally set the following flags:

          * The <a>sandboxed origin browsing context flag</a>.  This
            flag ensures that the browsing context cannot access content
            of (what was previously) the same origin. It also prevents
            <a>script from reading from or writing to the
              <code>document.cookie</code> IDL attribute</a>, and
            blocks access to <code>localStorage</code>. [[WEBSTORAGE]]

            <div class="note">
              The user agent MUST ensure that if content has access
              to another content from the same origin, but either ends
              up enabling <a>confinement mode</a> and has a
              non-<a>empty label</a>, access must be revoked and
              the two must be considered as if they are of different
              origins.  Th current version of this document specifies
              this requirement in terms of the <a>sandboxed origin
              browsing context flag</a>.

              ISSUE: Implementation-wise, this may pose a challenge
              for certain browsers. An alternative design may disallow
              enabling confinement mode if the browsing context has
              any references to or from another same-origin content.
              Feedback on this would be very welcome.
            </div>

          * The <a>sandboxed navigation browsing context flag</a>.

      ISSUE: Should COWL restrict communication via less overt
      channels (e.g., height/width of an iframe, URL fragment, or
      even)index in <code>window.top.frames</code>)? Maybe as optional
      modifications to HTML? Feedback on this would be very welcome.

    <h3 id="reduce-to-normal-form">Label Normal Form Reduction</h3>
    The <dfn>label normal form reduction</dfn> algorithm takes a
    <var>label</var> argument and produces a <a>Label</a> value
    according to the following steps:

    1. Let <var>lset</var> be the <a>label set</a> of an <a>empty label</a>.

    2. For each <a>disjunction set</a> <var>dset</var> in the
       <a>label set</a> of <var>label</var>:

       1. If there is no <a>disjunction set</a> in <var>lset</var>
          that is a subset of <var>dset</var>, then:

          1. Remove every <a>disjunction set</a> in <var>lset</var> that
             <var>dset</var> is a subset of.

          2. Add <var>dset</var> to <var>lset</var>.

    3. Return a newly created <a>Label</a> whose <a>label set</a> is <var>lset</var>.

    Note, this algorithms assumes that <a>disjunction sets</a> and
    <a>label sets</a> do not have duplicate elements, much like
    mathematical sets.

    <div class="example">
      The <a>Label</a> API uses this algorithm to ensure that labels
      don't have redundant information. Consider for example, the
      following labels:
      <pre><code>
        var a    = <a>Label("https://a.com")</a>;  // https://a.com
        var aORb = <a>Label("https://a.com")</a>.<a>_or("https://b.com")</a>; // https://a.com OR https://b.com
        var a2   = a.<a>and(aORb)</a>; // https://a.com AND (https://a.com OR https://b.com) &equiv; https://a.com
      </code></pre>

      The label <code>a2</code> is equivalent to <code>a</code> (since
      <code>a.<a>subsumes(aORb)</a></code>):

      <pre><code>
        JSON.stringify(a2) === '[["https://a.com"]]';

        <var>b</var>, return <code>true</code>.

    <!-- TODO: link subset -->

    2. Else, return <code>false</code>.

    Note, when interpreting labels as mathematical formulae, <a>label
    subsumption</a> is logical implication: <var>A</var>
    subsumes <var>B</var> is equivalent as <var>A</var>

    1. Let <var>privLabel</var> be the <a>internal privilege label</a>
       of <var>priv</var>.

    2. Let <var>lset</var> be the <a>label set</a> of an <a>empty label</a>.

    2. For each <a>disjunction set</a> <var>dset</var> in the
       <a>label set</a> of <var>label</var>:

       1. Let <var>cur</var> be a newly create <a interface>Label</a>
          whose <a>label set</a> is <var>dset</var>.

       2. If <var>privLabel</var> does not <a>subsume</a>

    3. Return a newly created <a>Label</a> whose <a>label set</a> is <var>lset</var>.

    Note, <a>label downgrade</a> removes every disjunction set

    steps:

    1. Let <var>privLabel</var> be the <a>internal privilege label</a>

    When a user agent is required to obtain a <a>structured clone</a>
    of an object whose type is defined in this document, it MUST use
    an algorithm whose behavior is as follows:

    1. Let <var>input</var> be the value being cloned.

    2. If <var>input</var> is a <a interface>Label</a> object, let
       <var>output</var> be a newly constructed <a interface>Label</a>
       object with the same <a>label set</a> as that of
       <var>input</var>.

    3. If <var>input</var> is a <a interface>Privilege</a> object
       that was constructed with the <a>FreshPrivilege()</a>
       constructor, let <var>output</var> be a newly constructed <a
       interface>Privilege</a> object with the same <a>internal
       privilege label</a> as that of <var>input</var>.

       <div class="note">
       To prevent attacks that launder page privileges, the current
       version of COWL only allows transferring fresh privileges.

       ISSUE: We can be more permissive and allow transferring all but
       <a>default privileges</a>. Feedback on this would be welcome.

    5. Return <var>output</var>.

    Note, cross-context messaging constructs such as

      Should fetching <var>request</var> be blocked as COWL?
    </h3>
    <div class="note">
      Note: this algorithm is used to determine whether a request should
      be entirely blocked, because it may potentially leak sensitive
      data to an unauthorized server.
    </div>

    Given a <a>Request</a> <var>request</var>, a user agent determines
    whether the <a>Request</a> <var>request</var> should proceed or
    not via the following algorithm:

    1. Let <var>context</var> be the <a>client</a>
       associated with the <var>request</var>.

    2. If <var>context</var> is null, let <var>context</var> be the
       <a>incumbent settings object</a>.

       Note, the <a>client</a> associated with the
       <var>request</var> is null when <a>navigating</a>, so we use
       the <a>incumbent settings object</a> to get the <a>COWL
       state</a> of the <a>context</a> that initiated the request.

    2. Let <var>state</var> be the <a>COWL state</a> retrieved via the
       <a>environment settings object</a> <var>context</var>.

    3. If the <var>state</var> <a>confinement mode</a> is not
       enabled, return <strong>allowed</strong> and terminated this
       algorithm.

    4. Let <var>conf</var> be the <var>state</var> <a>effective confidentiality label</a>.

    6. Let <var>dstConf</var> be the <a integrity>Label</a> created by invoking
       the <a>Label(origin)</a> constructor with the
       <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url">url</a>

    7. If <var>dstConf</var> <a>subsumes</a> <var>conf</var>, return

    8. Else:

        1. If the <var>request</var> is a <a>navigation request</a>
           and the <var>request</var>'s <a>context frame type</a> is
           <code>top-level</code> the user agent MAY return
           <strong>allowed</strong>, but MUST indicate to the user
           that data labeled <var>conf</var> may have been leaked due
           to the navigation.  It is RECOMMENDED that user agents give
           users the options to block the navigation, e.g., via a
           pop-up dialog.

           ISSUE: We can simply disallow leaks via top-level
           navigation at the cost of potentially forcing users to
           navigate away by closing tabs or inputting another URL via
           the address bar.  Feedback on this would be welcome.

        2. Else, return <strong>blocked</strong>.

    Note, the integrity label of the current context is not used in
    this algorithm since, conceptually, the integrity label of a
    server is the <a>empty label</a> and, thus, always subsumed.
    Server operators SHOULD check the
    <a href="#request-header"><code>Sec-COWL</code></a> request header
    to ensure untrustworthy data does not affect the computation in an
    unsafe way.
