<section class="informative">
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>Sites and applications on the web are rarely composed of resources from
only a single origin. Authors pull scripts, images, fonts, etc. from a
wide variety of services and content delivery networks, and must trust
that the delivered representation is, in fact, what they expected to
load. If an attacker can trick a user into downloading content from
a hostile server (via DNS poisoning, or other such means), the author has
no recourse. Likewise, an attacker who can replace the file on the CDN server
has the ability to inject arbitrary content.</p>

  <p>Delivering resources over a secure channel mitigates some of this risk: with
TLS, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">HSTS</a>, and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning">pinned public keys</a>, a user agent can be fairly certain
that it is indeed speaking with the server it believes it&#8217;s talking to. These
mechanisms, however, authenticate <em>only</em> the server, <em>not</em> the content. An
attacker (or admin!) with access to the server can manipulate content with
impunity. Ideally, authors would not only be able to pin the keys of a
server, but also pin the <em>content</em>, ensuring that an exact representation of
a resource, and <em>only</em> that representation, loads and executes.</p>

  <p>This document specifies such a validation scheme, extending several HTML
elements with a <code>integrity</code> attribute that contains a cryptographic hash of
the representation of the resource the author expects to load. For instance,
an author may wish to load jQuery from a shared server rather than hosting it
on their own origin. Specifying that the <em>expected</em> SHA-256 hash of
<code>https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js</code>
is <code>C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh_E1uhG5Twh-Y5qFQmYg</code> means
that the user agent can verify that the data it loads from that URL matches
that expected hash before executing the JavaScript it contains. This
integrity verification significantly reduces the risk that an attacker can
substitute malicious content.</p>

  <p>This example can be communicated to a user agent by adding the hash to a
<code>script</code> element, like so:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"
        integrity="ni:///sha-256;C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh_E1uhG5Twh-Y5qFQmYg?ct=application/javascript"&gt;
</code></pre>

  <p>Scripts, of course, are not the only resource type which would benefit
from integrity validation. The scheme specified here applies to all HTML
elements which trigger fetches, as well as to fetches triggered from CSS
and JavaScript.</p>

  <p>Moreover, integrity metadata may also be useful for purposes other than
validation. User agents may decide to use the integrity metadata as an
identifier in a local cache, for instance, meaning that common resources
(for example, JavaScript libraries) could be cached and retrieved once,
regardless of the URL from which they are loaded.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Compromise of the third-party service should not automatically mean
compromise of every site which includes its scripts. Content authors
will have a mechanism by which they can specify expectations for
content they load, meaning for example that they could load a
<em>specific</em> script, and not <em>any</em> script that happens to have a
particular URL.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The verification mechanism should extend to all resource types that
a page may fetch in the course of its execution and rendering. Active
content (scripts, style, <code>iframe</code> contents, etc) are, of course,
critical, but inactive content such as images and fonts will also be
covered.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The verification mechanism should have reporting functionality which
would inform the author that an invalid resource was downloaded.
Further it should be possible for an author to choose to run <em>only</em>
the reporting functionality, allowing potentially corrupt resources
to run on her site, but flagging violations for manual review.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The metadata provided for verification will enable improvements to
user agents&#8217; caching schemes: common resources such as JavaScript
libraries can be downloaded once, and only once, even if multiple
instances with distinct URLs are requested.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>(potentially) Relax mixed-content warnings for resources whose
integrity is verified. If the integrity metadata for a resource
is delivered over a secure channel, the user agent might choose to
allow loading the resource over an insecure channel.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>(potentially) Allow resources to be downloaded from non-canonical
sources (for instance, over an insecure channel) for performance,
but fall back to a canonical source if the non-canonical source
fails an integrity check. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

benefits that such a fallback system would enable. (mkwst)</p>

        <li>
          <p>An author wants to include JavaScript provided by a third-party
analytics service on her site. She wants, however, to ensure that only
the code she&#8217;s carefully reviewed is executed. She can do so by generating
<a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> for the script she&#8217;s planning on including, and
adding it to the <code>script</code> element she includes on her page:</p>

          <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://analytics-r-us.com/v1.0/include.js"
        integrity="ni:///sha-256;SDfwewFAE...wefjijfE?ct=application/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>An advertising network wishes to ensure that advertisements delivered via
third-party servers matches the code which they reviewed in order to reduce
the risk of accidental or malicious substitution of unreviewed content. By
adding <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> to the <code>iframe</code> element wrapping the
advertisement, they can ensure that the third-party server delivers only
the agreed-upon content.</p>

          <pre><code>&lt;iframe src="https://awesome-ads.com/advertisement1.html"
        integrity="ni:///sha-256;kasfdsaffs...eoirW-e?ct=text/html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A user agent wishes to ensure that pieces of its UI which are rendered via
HTML (for example, Chrome&#8217;s New Tab Page) aren&#8217;t manipulated before display.
<a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">Integrity metadata</a> mitigates the risk that altered JavaScript will run
in these page&#8217;s high-privilege context.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The author of a mash-up wants to make sure her creation remains in a working

expected revision of the included files. The author can then use the reporting
functionality to be notified of changes to the included resources.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="key-concepts-and-terminology">Key Concepts and Terminology</h3>

    <p>This section defines several terms used throughout the document.</p>

    <p>The term <dfn>digest</dfn> refers to the base64url-encoded result of
executing a cryptographic hash function on an arbitrary block of data.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>secure channel</dfn> is any communication mechanism that the user
agent has defined as &#8220;secure&#8221; (typically limited to HTTP over Transport
Layer Security (TLS) [[!RFC2818]]).</p>

    <p>An <dfn>insecure channel</dfn> is any communication mechanism other than
those the user agent has defined as &#8220;secure&#8221;.</p>

    <p>The term <dfn>origin</dfn> is defined in the Origin specification.
[[!RFC6454]]</p>

    <p>The <dfn>MIME type</dfn> of a resource is a technical hint about the use
and format of that resource. [[!MIMETYPE]]</p>

    <p>The <dfn>entity body</dfn>, <dfn>transfer encoding</dfn>, <dfn>content
encoding</dfn> and <dfn>message body</dfn> of a resource is defined by the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html">HTTP 1.1 specification, section 7.2</a>. [[!HTTP11]]</p>

    <p>A <dfn>base64url encoding</dfn> is defined in
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5">RFC 4648, section 5</a>. In a nutshell, it replaces the characters
U+002B PLUS SIGN (<code>+</code>) and U+002F SOLIDUS (<code>/</code>) characters in normal base64
encoding with the U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (<code>-</code>) and U+005F LOW LINE (<code>_</code>)
characters, respectively. [[!RFC4648]]</p>

    <p>The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation used in this document is
specified in RFC 5234. [[!ABNF]]</p>

    <p>The <dfn>SHA-256</dfn>, <dfn>SHA-384</dfn>, and <dfn>SHA-512</dfn> are part
of the <dfn>SHA-2</dfn> set of cryptographic hash functions defined by the
NIST in <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/sha256-384-512.pdf">&#8220;Descriptions of SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512&#8221;</a>.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="framework">Framework</h2>

  <p>The integrity verification mechanism specified here boils down to the
process of generating a sufficiently strong cryptographic digest for a
resource, and transmitting that digest to a user agent so that it may be
used when fetching the resource.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="integrity-metadata">Integrity metadata</h3>

    <p>To verify the integrity of a resource, a user agent requires <dfn>integrity
metadata</dfn>, which consists of the following pieces of information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>cryptographic hash function</li>
      <li><a href="#dfn-digest">digest</a></li>
      <li>the resource&#8217;s MIME type</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The hash function and digest MUST be provided in order to validate a
resource&#8217;s integrity. The MIME type SHOULD be provided, as it mitigates the
risk of certain attack vectors (see <a href="#mime-type-confusion">MIME Type confusion</a> in
this document&#8217;s Security Considerations section).</p>

    <p>This metadata is generally encoded as a &#8220;named information&#8221; (<code>ni</code>) URI, as
defined in RFC6920. [[!RFC6920]]</p>

    <p>For example, given a resource containing only the string &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221;,
an author might choose <a href="#dfn-sha-2">SHA-256</a> as a hash function.
<code>-MO_YqmqPm_BYZwlDkir51GTc9Pt9BvmLrXcRRma8u8</code> is the base64url-encoded
digest that results. This can be encoded as an <code>ni</code> URI as follows:</p>

    <pre><code>ni:///sha-256;-MO_YqmqPm_BYZwlDkir51GTc9Pt9BvmLrXcRRma8u8
</code></pre>

    <p>Or, if the author further wishes to specify the content type (<code>text/plain</code>):</p>

    <pre><code>ni:///sha-256;-MO_YqmqPm_BYZwlDkir51GTc9Pt9BvmLrXcRRma8u8?ct=text/plain
</code></pre>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Digests may be generated using any number of utilities. <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>, for
example, is quite commonly available. The example in this section is the
result of the following command line:</p>

      <pre><code>echo -n "Hello, world." | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64 | sed -e 's/+/-/g' -e 's/\//_/g'

      <h4 id="is-varresourcevar-eligible-for-integrity-validation">Is <var>resource</var> eligible for integrity validation</h4>

      <p>In order to mitigate an attackers ability to read data cross-origin by
brute-forcing values via integrity checks, resources are only eligible
for such checks if they are same-origin, publicly cachable, or is the
result of a granted the loading origin explicit access via CORS. [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#cors-cross-origin">CORS</a>]</p>

      <p>Certain HTTP headers can also change the way the resource behaves in
ways which integrity checking cannot account for. If the resource
contains these headers, it is ineligible for integrity validation:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>WWW-Authenticate</code> hides resources behind a login; such non-public
resources are excluded from integrity checks.</li>
        <li><code>Refresh</code> can cause IFrame contents to transparently redirect to an
unintended target, bypassing the integrity check.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="issue">Consider the impact of other headers: <code>Content-Length</code>, <code>Content-Range</code>,
etc. Is there danger there?</p>

      <p>The following algorithm details these restrictions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>request</var> be the request which fetched
<var>resource</var>.</li>
        <li>If <var>resource</var> contains any of the following HTTP headers,
return <code>false</code>:
          <ul>
            <li><code>WWW-Authenticate</code></li>
            <li><code>Refresh</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the <a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-mode">mode</a> of <var>request</var> is <code>CORS</code>,
return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>If the <a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-origin">origin</a> of <var>request</var> is
<var>resource</var>&#8217;s origin, return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>If <var>resource</var> is <a href="https://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/wg/httpbis/draft-ietf-httpbis/latest/p6-cache.html#response.cacheability">cachable by a shared cache</a>, as defined
in [[!HTTP11]], return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>Return <code>false</code>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note">Step 2 returns <code>true</code> if the resource was a CORS-enabled request. If the
resource failed the CORS checks, it won&#8217;t be available to us for integrity
checking because it won&#8217;t have loaded successfully.</p>

    <h3 id="verification-of-html-document-subresources">Verification of HTML document subresources</h3>

    <p>A variety of HTML elements result in requests for resources that are to be
embedded into the document, or executed in its context. To support integrity
metadata for each of these, and new elements that are added in the future,
a new <code>integrity</code> attribute is added to the list of content attributes for
the <code>a</code>, <code>audio</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>iframe</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>object</code>, <code>script</code>, <code>source</code>,
<code>track</code>, and <code>video</code> elements.</p>

    <p>A corresponding <code>integrity</code> IDL attribute which <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#reflect">reflects</a> the
value each element&#8217;s <code>integrity</code> content attribute is added to the
<code>HTMLAnchorElement</code>, <code>HTMLMediaElement</code>, <code>HTMLEmbedElement</code>,
<code>HTMLIframeElement</code>, <code>HTMLLinkElement</code>, <code>HTMLObjectElement</code>,
<code>HTMLScriptElement</code>, <code>HTMLSourceElement</code>, and <code>HTMLTrackElement</code>
interfaces.</p>

    <section>
      <h4 id="the-integrity-attribute">The <code>integrity</code> attribute</h4>

      <p>The <code>integrity</code> attribute represents <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> for an element.
The value of the attribute MUST be either the empty string, or one
valid &#8220;named information&#8221; (<code>ni</code>) URI [[!RFC6920]], as described by the
following ABNF grammar:</p>

      <pre><code>integrity-metatata = "" / 1#( *WSP NI-URL ) *WSP ]
</code></pre>

      <p>The <code>NI-URL</code> rule is defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920#section3">RFC6920, section 3, figure 4</a>.</p>

      <p>The <code>integrity</code> IDL attribute must <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#reflect">reflect</a> the <code>integrity</code> content attribute.</p>

      <p class="issue">We should consider supporting multiple <code>ni</code> URLs, which could allow migration
between algorithms.</p>

      <h4 id="the-noncanonical-src-attribute-todo">The <code>noncanonical-src</code> attribute (TODO)</h4>

      <p>Authors MAY opt-in to a fallback mechanism whereby user agents would initially
attempt to load resources from a non-canonical source (perhaps over HTTP, for
performance and caching reasons). If that fetch failed an integrity check, the
user agent would <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#dfn-report-a-violation">report a violation</a>, and retry the fetch using a canonical
URL (perhaps over HTTPS).</p>

      <p>The non-canonical URL is specified via a <code>noncanonical-src</code> attribute. For
example:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://example.com/script.js"
        noncanonical-src="http://cdn.example.com/script.js"
        integrity="ni:///sha-256;jsdfhiuwergn...vaaetgoifq?ct=application/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

      <p>The <code>noncanonicalSrc</code> IDL attribute MUST <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#reflect">reflect</a> the <code>noncanonical-src</code>
content attribute.</p>

      <p>The noncanonical resource MUST be fetched with its <a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-omit-credentials-mode">omit credentials
mode</a> set to <code>always</code>, to prevent leakage of cookies across insecure
channels.</p>

      <p class="issue">This attribute (and fallback in general) only makes sense if we care
about allowing cache-friendly (read &#8220;HTTP&#8221;) URLs to load in an HTTPS context
without warnings. I&#8217;m not sure we do, so I&#8217;m not going to put too much
thought into the details here before we discuss things a bit more. (mkwst)</p>

        <p>If an <code>a</code> element has both <code>integrity</code> and <code>download</code> attributes, the user

integrity metadata is added to any <code>a</code> element that does not explicitly
request that the resource it points to be downloaded, user agents MUST
treat the link as broken.</p>

        <p>Before <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#following-hyperlinks">following a hyperlink</a>, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

empty string, then:
            <ol>

  <h3 id="caching-optional">Caching (Optional)</h3>

  <p>The caching mechanism described in this section is OPTIONAL.</p>

  <p>JavaScript libraries are a good example of resources that are often loaded
and reloaded from different locations as users browse the web:
<code>http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js</code> is
exactly the same file as
<code>https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js</code>. Both
files are identifiable via the <code>ni</code> URL
<code>ni:///sha-256;iaFenEC8axSAnyNu6M0-0epCOTwfbKVceFXNd5s_ki4?ct=application/javascript</code>.</p>

  <p>To reduce the performance impact of reloading the same data, user agents
MAY use <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> as a new index to a local cache, meaning that
a user who had already loaded a version of the file from <code>ajax.googleapis.com</code>
wouldn&#8217;t have to touch the network to load the <code>cdnjs.cloudflare.com</code> version.
The user agent knows that the content is the same, and would be free to treat
the latter as a cache hit, regardless of the location mismatch.</p>

  <section>
    <h4 id="risks">Risks</h4>

    <p>This approach is good for performance, but can have security implications. See
the <a href="#origin-confusion">origin confusion</a> and <a href="#mime-type-confusion">MIME type confusion</a> sections below for some
details.</p>

    <section>
      <h5 id="origin-confusion">Origin confusion</h5>

      <p>User agents which set up a caching mechanism that uses only the integrity
metadata to identify a resource are vulnerable to attacks which bypass
same-origin restrictions unless they are very careful when choosing whether
or not to read data straight from the cache.</p>

      <p>For instance:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#runtime-script-errors">Runtime script errors</a> are sanitized for resources that are
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#cors-cross-origin">CORS-cross-origin</a> to the page into which they are loaded. [[!HTML5]]</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>XMLHttpRequest may only load data from same-origin resources, or from
resources delivered with proper CORS headers. [[!XMLHTTPREQUEST]]</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content Security Policy performs origin-based security checks. [[!CSP]]</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="issue">More?</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>The simple cache-poisoning version of this attack can be mitigated by
requiring strong hash functions for cachable resources. More complex
variants are more difficult to mitigate. Consider the following:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>An attacker lures Alice to a page containing the following code:</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://evil.com/evil.js" digest="ni://sha-256;123...789"&gt;
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Alice&#8217;s user agent loads <code>evil.js</code>, and stores it in her cache.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Though <code>bank.com</code> is protected by a CSP which allows only script from
<code>bank.com</code>, the attacker may still be able to exploit an XSS vulnerability
in <code>bank.com</code> which allows the injection of:</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://bank.com/awesome.js" digest="ni://sha-256;123...789"&gt;
</code></pre>

            <p>Since the script appears to come from <code>bank.com</code>, CSP allows it, even though
it doesn&#8217;t actually exist on that server.</p>

      <h5 id="mime-type-confusion">MIME type confusion</h5>

      <p>User agents which set up a caching mechanism that uses only the integrity
metadata to identify a resource are vulnerable to attacks which create
resources that behave differently based on the context in which they are
loaded. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifar">Gifar</a> is the canonical example of such an attack.</p>

      <p>Authors SHOULD mitigate this risk by specifying the expected content type
along with the digest, as specified in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920#section-3.1">RFC 6920, section 3.1</a>.
This means that the content type will be verified along with the digest when
determining whether a <a href="#does-resource-match-metadata">resource matches certain integrity
metadata</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h4>

    <p>To mitigate the risk of cross-origin data leakage or type-sniffing
exploitation, user agents that take this approach to caching MUST NOT
use <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> as a cache identifier unless the following
are all true:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The integrity metadata contains a content type.</li>
      <li>The resource was delivered in response to an HTTP <code>GET</code> request (and not
<code>POST</code>, <code>OPTIONS</code>, <code>TRACE</code>, etc.)</li>
      <li>The resource was delivered with an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> HTTP
header with a value of <code>*</code> [[!CORS]]</li>
      <li>The integrity metadata uses a hash function with very strong uniqueness
characteristics: SHA-512 or better.</li>
      <li>If a Content Security Policy is active in a context, the <code>script</code> or
<code>link</code> element which triggered the resource&#8217;s fetch has a <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/content-security-policy/csp-specification.dev.html#valid-nonces">valid nonce</a>.</li>
    </ul>

<section>
  <h2 id="proxies">Proxies</h2>

  <p>Optimizing proxies and other intermediate servers which modify the
content of fetched resources MUST ensure that the digest associated
with those resources stays in sync with the new content. One option
is to ensure that the <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> associated with
resources is updated along with the resource itself. Another
would be simply to deliver only the canonical version of resources
for which a page author has requested integrity verification. To
support this latter option, user agents MAY send a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9"><code>Cache-Control</code></a> header with a value of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.5"><code>no-transform</code></a>.</p>

    <p><a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">Integrity metadata</a> delivered over an insecure channel provides no security

    <p>Digests are only as strong as the hash function used to generate them. User

collision-resistant. At the time of writing, SHA-256 is a good baseline.
Moreover, user agents SHOULD reevaluate their supported hashing functions
on a regular basis, and deprecate support for those functions shown to be
insecure.</p>

    <h3 id="cross-origin-data-leakage">Cross-origin data leakage</h3>

    <p>Attackers can determine whether some cross-origin resource has certain
content by attempting to load it with a known digest, and watching for
load failure. If the load fails, the attacker can surmise that the
resource didn&#8217;t match the hash, and thereby gain some insight into its
contents. This might reveal, for example, whether or not a user is
logged into a particular service.</p>

    <p>Moreover, attackers can brute-force specific values in an otherwise
static resource: consider a document that looks like this:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;{static content}&lt;h1&gt;Hello, $username!&lt;/h1&gt;{static content}&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>An attacker can precompute hashes for the page with a variety of
common usernames, and specify those hashes while repeatedly attempting
to load the document. By examining the reported violations, the attacker
can obtain a user&#8217;s username.</p>

    <p>User agents SHOULD mitigate the risk by refusing to fire <code>error</code> events
on elements which loaded cross-origin resources, but some side-channels
will likely be difficult to avoid (image&#8217;s <code>naturalHeight</code> and
<code>naturalWidth</code> for instance).</p>
