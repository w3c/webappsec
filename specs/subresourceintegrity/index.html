<section class="informative">
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>It is rare indeed to find a self-contained document on the web. Instead, we
interact with collages of resources loaded from a variety of origins. User
agents fetch these resources blindly; data that comes in is accepted as
canonical, rendered or executed, and cached. Authors must trust that the
resource their content delivery network delivers is in fact the same resource
they expect. If an attacker can trick a user into downloading content from
a different server (via DNS poisioning, or other such means), the author has
no recourse. Likewise, an attacker who can replace the file on the CDN server
has the ability to inject arbitrary content.</p>

  <p>Delivering resources over a secure channel mitigates some of this risk: with
TLS, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">HSTS</a>, and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning">pinned public keys</a>, a user agent can be fairly certain
that it is indeed speaking with the server it believes it&rsquo;s talking to. The
threat of an attacker (or admin!) manipulating content on a third-party server
is very common in advertising networks, for instance. Ideally, authors would
not only be able to pin the keys of a server, but also pin the <em>content</em>,
ensuring that the exact resource, and <em>only</em> that resource, loads.</p>

  <p>This document specifies such a validation scheme, extending several HTML
elements with a <code>integrity</code> attribute that contains a cryptographic hash of
the contents of the resource the author expects to load. For instance, an
author may wish to load jQuery from a shared server rather than hosting it
on their own origin. Specifying that the <em>expected</em> SHA-256 hash of
<code>https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js</code>
is <code>C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh_E1uhG5Twh-Y5qFQmYg</code> means
that the user agent can verify that the data it loads from that URL matches
that expected hash before executing the JavaScript it contains. This
integrity verification significantly reduces the risk that an attacker can
substitute malicious content.</p>

  <p>This example can be communicated to a user agent by adding the hash to a
<code>script</code> element, like so:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"
        integrity="ni:///sha-256;C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh_E1uhG5Twh-Y5qFQmYg?ct=application/javascript"&gt;
</code></pre>

  <p>Scripts, of course, are not the only resource type which would benifit
from integrity validation. The scheme specified here applies to all HTML
elements which trigger fetches, as well as to fetches triggered from CSS
and JavaScript.</p>

  <p>Moreover, integrity metadata may also be useful for purposes other than
validation. User agents may decide to use the integrity metadata as an
identifier in a local cache, for instance, meaning that common resources
(for example, JavaScript libraries) could be cached and retrieved once,
regardless of the URL from which they are loaded.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Compromise of the third-party service should not automatically mean
compromise of every site which includes its scripts. Content authors
will have a mechanism by which they can specify expectations for
content they load, meaning for example that they could load a
<em>specific</em> script, and not <em>any</em> script that happens to have a
particular URL.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The verification mechanism should extend to all resource types that
a page may fetch in the course of its execution and rendering. Active
content (scripts, style, <code>iframe</code> contents, etc) are, of course,
critical, but inactive content such as images and fonts will also be
covered.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The verification mechanism should have reporting functionality which
would inform the author that an invalid resource was downloaded.
Further it should be possible for an author to choose to run <em>only</em>
the reporting functionality, allowing potentially corrupt resources
to run on her site, but flagging violations for manual review.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The metadata provided for verification will enable improvements to
user agents&rsquo; caching schemes: common resources such as JavaScript
libraries can be downloaded once, and only once, even if multiple
instances with distinct URLs are requested.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>(potentially) Relax mixed-content warnings for resources whose
integrity is verified. If the integrity metadata for a resource
is delivered over a secure channel, the user agent might choose to
allow loading the resource over an insecure channel.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>(potentially) Allow resources to be downloaded from non-canonical
sources (for instance, over an insecure channel) for performance,
but fall back to a canonical source if the non-canonical source
fails an integrity check. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="todo">I&rsquo;m not sure about #5 and #6. Get more detail from the WG about the
benefits that such a fallback system would enable. (mkwst)</p>

    <h3 id="use-casesexamples">Use Cases/Examples</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>An author wants to include JavaScript provided by a third-party
analytics service on her site. She wants, however, to ensure that only
the code she&rsquo;s carefully reviewed is executed. She can do so by generating
<a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> for the script she&rsquo;s planning on including, and
adding it to the <code>script</code> element she includes on her page:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://analytics-r-us.com/v1.0/include.js"
        integrity="ni:///sha-256;SDfwewFAE...wefjijfE?ct=application/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An advertising network wishes to ensure that advertisements delivered via
third-party servers matches the code which they reviewed in order to reduce
the risk of accidental or malicious substitution of unreviewed content. By
adding <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> to the <code>iframe</code> element wrapping the
advertisement, they can ensure that the third-party server delivers only
the agreed-upon content.</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;iframe src="https://awesome-ads.com/advertisement1.html"
        integrity="ni:///sha-256;kasfdsaffs...eoirW-e?ct=text/html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A software distribution service wants to ensure that files are correctly
downloaded. It can do so by adding <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> to the <code>a</code>
elements which users click on to trigger a download:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;a href="https://software-is-nice.com/awesome.exe"
   integrity="ni:///sha-256;fkfrewFRFEFHJR...wfjfrErw?ct=application/octet-stream"
   download&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A user agent wishes to ensure that pieces of its UI which are rendered via
HTML aren&rsquo;t manipulated before display. <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">Integrity metadata</a> mitigates the
risk that altered JavaScript will run in a high-privilege context.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The author of a mash-up wants to make sure her creation remains in a working
state. Adding <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> to external subresources defines an
expected revision of the included files. The author can then use the reporting
functionality to be notified of changes to the included resources.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An author wishes to load a resource over an insecure channel for performance
reasons, but fall back to a secure channel if the insecurely-loaded resource
is manipulated. She can do this by adding <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> and a
<a href="#the-noncanonical-src-attribute">non-canonical source</a> to the <code>script</code> element:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://rockin-resources.com/script.js"
        noncanonical-src="http://insecurity-is-inherent.net/script.js"
        integrity="ni:///sha-256;asijfiqu4t12...woeji3W?ct=application/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<section id="conformance">
  <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can be
implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. In
particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to
be easy to understand and are not intended to be performant. Implementers

  <section>
    <h3 id="key-concepts-and-terminology">Key Concepts and Terminology</h3>

    <p>This section defines several terms used throughout the document.</p>

    <p>The term <dfn>digest</dfn> refers to the base64url-encoded result of
executing a cryptographic hash function on an arbitrary block of data.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>secure channel</dfn> is any communication mechanism that the user
agent has defined as &ldquo;secure&rdquo; (typically limited to HTTP over Transport
Layer Security (TLS) [[!RFC2818]]).</p>

    <p>An <dfn>insecure channel</dfn> is any communication mechanism other than
those the user agent has defined as &ldquo;secure&rdquo;.</p>

    <p>The term <dfn>origin</dfn> is defined in the Origin specification.
[[!RFC6454]]</p>

    <p>The <dfn>MIME type</dfn> of a resource is a technical hint about the use
and format of that resource. [[!MIMETYPE]]</p>

    <p>The <dfn>entity body</dfn>, <dfn>transfer encoding</dfn>, <dfn>content
encoding</dfn> and <dfn>message body</dfn> of a resource is defined by the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html">HTTP 1.1 specification, section 7.2</a>. [[!HTTP11]]</p>

    <p>A <dfn>base64url encoding</dfn> is defined in
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5">RFC 4648, section 5</a>. In a nutshell, it replaces the characters
U+002B PLUS SIGN (<code>+</code>) and U+002F SOLIDUS (<code>/</code>) characters in normal base64
encoding with the U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (<code>-</code>) and U+005F LOW LINE (<code>_</code>)
characters, respectively. [[!RFC4648]]</p>

    <p>The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation used in this document is
specified in RFC 5234. [[!ABNF]]</p>

    <p>The <dfn>SHA-256</dfn>, <dfn>SHA-384</dfn>, and <dfn>SHA-512</dfn> are part
of the <dfn>SHA-2</dfn> set of cryptographic hash functions defined by the
NIST in <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/sha256-384-512.pdf">&ldquo;Descriptions of SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512&rdquo;</a>.</p>

  </section>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="framework">Framework</h2>

  <p>The integrity verification mechanism specified here boils down to the
process of generating a sufficiently strong cryptographic digest for a
resource, and transmitting that digest to a user agent so that it may be
used when fetching the resource.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="integrity-metadata">Integrity metadata</h3>

    <p>To verify the integrity of a resource, a user agent requires <dfn>integrity
metadata</dfn>, which consists of the following pieces of information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>cryptographic hash function</li>
      <li><a href="#dfn-digest">digest</a></li>
      <li>the resource&rsquo;s MIME type</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The hash function and digest MUST be provided in order to validate a
resource&rsquo;s integrity. The MIME type SHOULD be provided, as it mitigates the
risk of certain attack vectors (see <a href="#mime-type-confusion">MIME Type confusion</a> in
this document&rsquo;s Security Considerations section).</p>

    <p>This metadata is generally encoded as a &ldquo;named information&rdquo; (<code>ni</code>) URI, as
defined in RFC6920. [[!RFC6920]]</p>

    <p>For example, given a resource containing only the string &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo;,
an author might choose <a href="#dfn-sha-2">SHA-256</a> as a hash function.
<code>-MO_YqmqPm_BYZwlDkir51GTc9Pt9BvmLrXcRRma8u8</code> is the base64url-encoded
digest that results. This can be encoded as an <code>ni</code> URI as follows:</p>

    <pre><code>ni:///sha-256;-MO_YqmqPm_BYZwlDkir51GTc9Pt9BvmLrXcRRma8u8
</code></pre>

    <p>Or, if the author further wishes to specify the content type (<code>text/plain</code>):</p>

    <pre><code>ni:///sha-256;-MO_YqmqPm_BYZwlDkir51GTc9Pt9BvmLrXcRRma8u8?ct=text/plain
</code></pre>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Digests may be generated using any number of utilities. <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>, for
example, is quite commonly available. The example in this section is the
result of the following command line:</p>

      <pre><code>echo -n "Hello, world." | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64 | sed -e 's/+/-/g' -e 's/\//_/g'

      <h4 id="is-varresourcevar-eligible-for-integrity-validation">Is <var>resource</var> eligible for integrity validation</h4>

      <p>In order to mitigate an attackers ability to read data cross-origin by
brute-forcing values via integrity checks, resources are only eligible
for such checks if they are same-origin, publically cachable, or have
granted the loading origin explicit access. The following algorithm
details these restrictions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>origin</var> be the <a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-origin">origin</a> of the request
which fetched <var>resource</var>.</li>
        <li>If <var>resource</var> would pass a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#resource-sharing-check-0">CORS resource sharing check</a>,
return <code>true</code>. If <var>resource</var> does not have an
<code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code> header, and is the result
of a <a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-fetch">basic fetch</a>, add such a header with a value of
<code>true</code> for the purposes of this check.</li>
        <li>If <var>resource</var> is <a href="https://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/wg/httpbis/draft-ietf-httpbis/latest/p6-cache.html#response.cacheability">cachable by a shared cache</a>, as defined in
[[!HTTP11]], return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>Return <code>false</code>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note">The &ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&rdquo; addition in step #2 above exists
because basic fetches would fail a CORS check due to steps 4 and 5 of
the resource sharing check even if they contained a
&lsquo;Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *&rsquo; header.</p>

    <p>The Fetch specification should contain the following modifications in order
to enable the rest of this specification&rsquo;s work:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The following text should be added to section 2.2: &ldquo;A
<a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request">request</a> has an associated <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a>.
Unless stated otherwise, a request&rsquo;s integrity metadata is the empty
string.&rdquo;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The following text should be added to section 2.3: &ldquo;A
<a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-response">response</a> has an associated integrity state, which
is one of <code>indeterminate</code>, <code>pending</code>, <code>corrupt</code>, and <code>intact</code>. Unless
stated otherwise, it is <code>indeterminate</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A &ldquo;HTTP <code>CH-Integrity</code> header&rdquo; section should be added to section
3, containing the contents of <a href="#the-ch-integrity-client-hint">section 5.1</a> of this specification.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add the following steps to both the &ldquo;basic fetch&rdquo; and &ldquo;CORS fetch with

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If <var>request</var>&rsquo;s integrity metadata is the empty string, set
<var>response</var>&rsquo;s integrity state to <code>indeterminate</code>. Otherwise:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Set <var>response</var>&rsquo;s integrity state to <code>pending</code>.</li>

    <h3 id="verification-of-html-document-subresources">Verification of HTML document subresources</h3>

    <p>A variety of HTML elements result in requests for resources that are to be
embedded into the document, or executed in its context. To support integrity
metadata for each of these, and new elements that are added in the future,
a new <code>integrity</code> attribute is added to HTML5&rsquo;s list of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#global-attributes">global attributes</a> that MAY be specified on any HTML element, and
a corresponding attribute is added to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#htmlelement"><code>HTMLElement</code>
interface</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h4 id="the-integrity-attribute">The <code>integrity</code> attribute</h4>

      <p>The <code>integrity</code> attribute represents <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> for an element.
The value of the attribute MUST be either the empty string, or a valid &ldquo;named
information&rdquo; (<code>ni</code>) URI. [[!RFC6920]]</p>

      <p>The <code>integrity</code> IDL attribute must <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#reflect">reflect</a> the <code>integrity</code> content attribute.</p>

      <h4 id="the-noncanonical-src-attribute">The <code>noncanonical-src</code> attribute</h4>

      <p>Authors MAY opt-in to a fallback mechanism whereby user agents would initially
attempt to load resources from a non-canonical source (perhaps over HTTP, for
performance and caching reasons). If that fetch failed an integrity check, the
user agent would <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#dfn-report-a-violation">report a violation</a>, and retry the fetch using a canonical
URL (perhaps over HTTPS).</p>

      <p>The non-canonical URL is specified via a <code>noncanonical-src</code> attribute. For
example:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://example.com/script.js"
        noncanonical-src="http://cdn.example.com/script.js"
        integrity="ni:///sha-256;jsdfhiuwergn...vaaetgoifq?ct=application/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

      <p>The <code>noncanonicalSrc</code> IDL attribute MUST <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#reflect">reflect</a> the <code>noncanonical-src</code>
content attribute.</p>

      <p>The noncanonical resource MUST be fetched with its <a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-omit-credentials-mode">omit credentials
mode</a> set to <code>always</code>, to prevent leakage of cookies across insecure
channels.</p>

      <p>TODO: This attribute (and fallback in general) only makes sense if we care
about allowing cache-friendly (read &ldquo;HTTP&rdquo;) URLs to load in an HTTPS context
without warnings. I&rsquo;m not sure we do, so I&rsquo;m not going to put too much
thought into the details here before we discuss things a bit more. (mkwst)</p>

      <p>Documents may specify the behavior of a failed integrity check by delivering
a <a href="http://w3.org/TR/CSP11">Content Security Policy</a> which contains an <code>integrity-policy</code>
directive, defined by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

      <pre><code>directive-name  = "integrity-policy"
directive-value = 1#failure-mode [ "require-for-all" ]
failure-mode    = ( "block" / "report" / "fallback" )
</code></pre>

      <p>A documents&rsquo;s <dfn>integrity policy</dfn> is the value of the
<code>integrity-policy</code> directive, if explicitly provided as part of the
document&rsquo;s Content Security Policy, or <code>block</code> otherwise.</p>

      <p>If the document&rsquo;s integrity policy contains <code>block</code>, the user agent MUST refuse
to render or execute resources that fail an integrity check, <em>and</em> MUST
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#dfn-report-a-violation">report a violation</a>.</p>

      <p>If the document&rsquo;s integrity policy contains <code>report</code>, the user agent MAY render
or execute resources that fail an integrity check, <em>but</em> MUST
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#dfn-report-a-violation">report a violation</a>.</p>

      <p class="todo">If the document&rsquo;s integrity policy contains <code>fallback</code>, the user agent MUST
refuse to render or execute resources that fail an integrity check, <em>and</em>
MUST <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#dfn-report-a-violation">report a violation</a>. The user agent MAY additionally choose to load
a fallback resource as specified for each relevant element. If the fallback
resource fails an integrity check, the user agent MUST refuse to render or
execute the resource, <em>and</em> MUST <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#dfn-report-a-violation">report a(nother)
violation</a>. (See <a href="#the-noncanonical-src-attribute">the <code>noncanonical-src</code>
attribute</a> for a strawman of how that might look).</p>

      <p class="todo">If the document&rsquo;s integrity policy contains <code>require-for-all</code>, the user agent
MUST treat the lack of <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> for an resource as automatic
failure, refuse to fetch the resource, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#dfn-report-a-violation">report a violation</a>.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Two strawmen. We should poke someone like Tab about these; he&rsquo;ll have
ideas. Or at least opinions.</p>

      <p>Idea #1: add an <code>@integrity</code> block at the beginning of a CSS file that
contains a list of <code>@resource</code> rules, each containing a <code>url()</code> and a
<code>integrity()</code>. Something like:</p>

      <pre><code>@integrity {
    @resource: url(http://example.com/cat.gif)
               integrity(ni:///sha-256;3587cb776ce0e4...c838c423);
    @resource: url(http://not-example.com/another-cat.gif)
               integrity(ni:///sha-256;kljhfigrregq34...298jndkd);
}
</code></pre>

      <p>Idea #2: add a <code>integrity()</code> to each instance where we load a URL (this
is a poor general solution because repetition, but might work for
one-offs if we think those are more likely). Something like:</p>

      <pre><code>.awesomeness {
    background-image: url(http://example.com/cat.gif)
                      integrity(ni:///sha-256;3587cb776ce0e4...c838c423);
}
</code></pre>

      <p>or</p>

      <pre><code>@font-face {
    font-family: IntegralFont;
    src: url(font.woff)
         integrity(ni:///sha-256;3587cb776ce0e4...c838c423);
}
</code></pre>

      <p>Hope someone else has better ideas.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>Tab suggested that idea #1 is bad, as it would be quite fragile and easy
for authors to add or change resources without updating the integrity
section.</p>

      <p>I think he&rsquo;s suggested something like:</p>

      <pre><code>.awesomeness {
    background-image: integrity(&lt;url&gt;, &lt;metadata&gt;);
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Validation only takes place when the entire resource body has been

completed, one way or another.</p>

        <p>If the document&rsquo;s <a href="#dfn-integrity-policy">integrity policy</a> is not <code>block</code>, developers who

  <h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>

  <p>JavaScript libraries are a good example of resources that are often loaded
and reloaded from different locations as users browse the web:
<code>http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js</code> is
exactly the same file as
<code>https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js</code>. Both
files are identifiable via the <code>ni</code> URL
<code>ni:///sha-256;iaFenEC8axSAnyNu6M0-0epCOTwfbKVceFXNd5s_ki4?ct=application/javascript</code>.</p>

  <p>To reduce the performance impact of reloading the same data, user agents
MAY use <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> as a new index to a local cache, meaning that
a user who had already loaded a version of the file from <code>ajax.googleapis.com</code>
wouldn&rsquo;t have to touch the network to load the <code>cdnjs.cloudflare.com</code> version.
The user agent knows that the content is the same, and would be free to treat
the latter as a cache hit, regardless of the location mismatch.</p>

  <section>
    <h4 id="risks">Risks</h4>

    <p>This approach is good for performance, but can have security implications. See
the <a href="#origin-confusion">origin confusion</a> and <a href="#mime-type-confusion">MIME type confusion</a> sections below for some
details.</p>

    <section>
      <h5 id="origin-confusion">Origin confusion</h5>

      <p>User agents which set up a caching mechanism that uses only the integrity
metadata to identify a resource are vulnerable to attacks which bypass
same-origin restrictions unless they are very careful when choosing whether
or not to read data straight from the cache.</p>

      <p>For instance:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#runtime-script-errors">Runtime script errors</a> are sanitized for resources that are
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#cors-cross-origin">CORS-cross-origin</a> to the page into which they are loaded. [[!HTML5]]</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>XMLHttpRequest may only load data from same-origin resources, or from
resources delivered with proper CORS headers. [[!XMLHTTPREQUEST]]</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content Security Policy performs origin-based security checks. [[!CSP]]</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="todo">TODO: Moar?</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>The simple cache-poisoning version of this attack can be mitigated by
requiring strong hash functions for cachable resources. More complex
variants are more difficult to mitigate. Consider the following:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>An attacker lures Alice to a page containing the following code:</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://evil.com/evil.js" digest="ni://sha-256;123...789"&gt;
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Alice&rsquo;s user agent loads <code>evil.js</code>, and stores it in her cache.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Though <code>bank.com</code> is protected by a CSP which allows only script from
<code>bank.com</code>, the attacker may still be able to exploit an XSS vulnerability
in <code>bank.com</code> which allows the injection of:</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://bank.com/awesome.js" digest="ni://sha-256;123...789"&gt;
</code></pre>

            <p>Since the script appears to come from <code>bank.com</code>, CSP allows it, even though
it doesn&rsquo;t actually exist on that server.</p>

      <p>User agents which set up a caching mechanism that uses only the integrity
metadata to identify a resource are vulnerable to attacks which create
resources that behave differently based on the context in which they are
loaded. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifar">Gifar</a> is the canonical example of such an attack.</p>

      <p>Authors SHOULD mitigate this risk by specifing the expected content type
along with the digest, as specified in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920#section-3.1">RFC 6920, section 3.1</a>.
This means that the content type will be verified along with the digest when
determining whether a <a href="#does-resource-match-metadata">resource matches certain integrity
metadata</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h4>

    <p>To mitigate the risk of cross-origin data leakage or type-sniffing
exploitation, user agents that take this approach to caching MUST NOT
use <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> as a cache identifier unless the following
are all true:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The integrity metadata contains a content type.</li>
      <li>The resource was delivered in response to an HTTP <code>GET</code> request (and not
<code>POST</code>, <code>OPTIONS</code>, <code>TRACE</code>, etc.)</li>
      <li>The resource was delivered with an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> HTTP
header with a value of <code>*</code> [[!CORS]]</li>
      <li>The integrity metadata uses a hash function with very strong uniqueness
characteristics: SHA-512 or better.</li>
    </ul>

hash functions seems like a reasonable start&hellip;</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="proxies">Proxies</h2>

  <p>Optimizing proxies and other intermediate servers which modify the
content of fetched resources MUST ensure that the digest associated
with those resources stays in sync with the new content. One option
is to ensure that the <a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">integrity metadata</a> associated with
resources is updated along with the resource itself. Another
would be simply to deliver only the canonical version of resources
for which a page author has requested integrity verification. To
support this latter option, user agents MAY send an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grigorik-http-client-hints">HTTP Client
Hint</a>, as described below:</p>

  <p class="todo">TODO: think about how integrity checks would effect <code>vary</code> headers
in general.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="the-ch-integrity-client-hint">The <code>CH-Integrity</code> client hint</h3>

    <p>The <code>CH-Integrity</code> HTTP request header informs a server that a
resource will only be accepted if delivered in its canonical form:
in other words, the page author has placed a higher importance on
integrity than other considerations (filesize, performance, etc).</p>

    <pre><code>"CH-Integrity:" integrity-value
integrity-value = 1#( 1 / 0 )
</code></pre>

    <p>A value of <code>1</code> means that the requested resource SHOULD be delivered
in its canonical form, without modification. A value of <code>0</code> means
that integrity checking is irrelevant to this fetch, and modifications
MAY be performed without violating integrity checks.</p>

    <p class="note">This could be considered the request-side equivalent of a <code>Cache-Control</code>
response header with a value of <code>no-transform</code>.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="insecure-channels-remain-insecure">Insecure channels remain insecure</h3>

    <p><a href="#dfn-integrity-metadata">Integrity metadata</a> delivered over an insecure channel provides no security
benefit. Attackers can alter the digest in-flight (or remove it entirely (or
do absolutely anything else to the document)), just as they could alter the
resource the hash is meant to validate. Authors who desire any sort of
security whatsoever SHOULD deliver resources containing digests over
secure channels.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- /Security::Insecure channels -->

  <section>
    <h3 id="hash-collision-attacks">Hash collision attacks</h3>

    <p>Digests are only as strong as the hash function used to generate them. User
agents SHOULD refuse to support known-weak hashing functions like MD5, and
SHOULD restrict supported hashing functions to those known to be
collision-resistant. At the time of writing, SHA-256 is a good baseline.
Moreover, user agents SHOULD reevaluate their supported hashing functions
on a regular basis, and deprecate support for those functions shown to be
insecure.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- /Security::Hash collision -->

  <section>
    <h3 id="cross-origin-data-leakage">Cross-origin data leakage</h3>

    <p>Attackers can determine whether some cross-origin resource has certain
content by attempting to load it with a known digest, and watching for
load failure. If the load fails, the attacker can surmise that the
resource didn&rsquo;t match the hash, and thereby gain some insight into its
contents. This might reveal, for example, whether or not a user is
logged into a particular service.</p>

    <p>Moreover, attackers can brute-force specific values in an otherwise
static resource: consider a document that looks like this:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;{static content}&lt;h1&gt;Hello, $username!&lt;/h1&gt;{static content}&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>An attacker can precompute hashes for the page with a variety of
common usernames, and specify those hashes while repeatedly attempting
to load the document. By examining the reported violations, the attacker
can obtain a user&rsquo;s username.</p>

    <p>User agents SHOULD mitigate the risk by refusing to fire <code>error</code> events
on elements which loaded cross-origin resources, but some side-channels
will likely be difficult to avoid (image&rsquo;s <code>naturalHeight</code> and
<code>naturalWidth</code> for instance).</p>
