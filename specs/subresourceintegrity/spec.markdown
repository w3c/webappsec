## Introduction

Sites and applications on the web are rarely composed of resources from
only a single origin. For example, authors pull scripts and styles from a
wide variety of services and content delivery networks, and must trust
that the delivered representation is, in fact, what they expected to
load. If an attacker can trick a user into downloading content from
a hostile server (via DNS poisoning, or other such means), the author has
no recourse. Likewise, an attacker who can replace the file on the CDN server
has the ability to inject arbitrary content.

Delivering resources over a secure channel mitigates some of this risk: with
TLS, [HSTS][], and [pinned public keys][], a user agent can be fairly certain
that it is indeed speaking with the server it believes it's talking to. These
mechanisms, however, authenticate _only_ the server, _not_ the content. An
attacker (or administrator) with access to the server can manipulate content with
impunity. Ideally, authors would not only be able to pin the keys of a
server, but also pin the _content_, ensuring that an exact representation of
a resource, and _only_ that representation, loads and executes.

This document specifies such a validation scheme, extending several HTML
elements with an `integrity` attribute that contains a cryptographic hash of
the representation of the resource the author expects to load. For instance,
an author may wish to load some framework from a shared server rather than hosting it
on their own origin. Specifying that the _expected_ SHA-256 hash of
`https://example.com/example-framework.js`
is `C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh/E1uhG5Twh+Y5qFQmYg=` means
that the user agent can verify that the data it loads from that URL matches
that expected hash before executing the JavaScript it contains. This
integrity verification significantly reduces the risk that an attacker can
substitute malicious content.

This example can be communicated to a user agent by adding the hash to a
`script` element, like so:

    <script src="https://example.com/example-framework.js"
            integrity="sha256-C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh/E1uhG5Twh+Y5qFQmYg="
            crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

{:.example}

Scripts, of course, are not the only resource type which would benefit
from integrity validation. The scheme specified here also applies to `link`
and future versions of the specification are likely to expand this coverage.

<section>
### Goals

1.  Compromise of the third-party service should not automatically mean
    compromise of every site which includes its scripts. Content authors
    will have a mechanism by which they can specify expectations for
    content they load, meaning for example that they could load a
    _specific_ script, and not _any_ script that happens to have a
    particular URL.

2.  The verification mechanism should have error-reporting functionality which
    would inform the author that an invalid resource was downloaded.

<section>
### Use Cases/Examples

<section>
#### Resource Integrity

*   An author wishes to use a content delivery network to improve performance
    for globally-distributed users. It is important, however, to ensure that
    the CDN's servers deliver _only_ the code the author expects them to
    deliver. To mitigate the risk that a CDN compromise (or unexpectedly malicious
    behavior) would change that site in unfortunate ways, the following
    [integrity metadata][] is added to the `link` element included on the page:

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://site53.example.net/style.css"
              integrity="sha256-vjnUh7+rXHH2lg/5vDY8032ftNVCIEC21vL6szrVw9M="
              crossorigin="anonymous">
    {:.example}

*   An author wants to include JavaScript provided by a third-party
    analytics service. To ensure that only the code that has been carefully
    reviewed is executed, the author generates [integrity metadata][] for
    the script, and adds it to the `script` element:

        <script src="https://analytics-r-us.example.com/v1.0/include.js"
                integrity="sha256-Rj/9XDU7F6pNSX8yBddiCIIS+XKDTtdq0//No0MH0AE="
                crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    {:.example}

*   A user agent wishes to ensure that JavaScript code running in high-privilege HTML 
    contexts (for example, a browser's New Tab page) aren't manipulated before display.
    [Integrity metadata][] mitigates the risk that altered JavaScript will run
    in these pages' high-privilege contexts.

<section id="conformance">
Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can be
implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. In
particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to
be easy to understand and are not intended to be performant. Implementers
are encouraged to optimize.

<section>
### Key Concepts and Terminology

This section defines several terms used throughout the document.

The term <dfn>digest</dfn> refers to the base64-encoded result of
executing a cryptographic hash function on an arbitrary block of data.

The term <dfn>origin</dfn> is defined in the Origin specification.
[[!RFC6454]]

The terms <dfn>secure document</dfn> and
<dfn>secure context</dfn> are defined in [section 2 of the Secure

is an origin whose scheme component is <code>HTTPS</code>.

[potentially secure origin]: #dfn-potentially-secure-origin
[mixedcontent]: https://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/#potentially-secure-origin

The <dfn>message body</dfn> and the <dfn>transfer encoding</dfn> of a resource

[messagebody]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3

The <dfn>representation data</dfn> and <dfn>content encoding</dfn> of a resource
are defined by [RFC7231, section 3][representationdata]. [[!RFC7231]]

A <dfn>base64 encoding</dfn> is defined in [RFC 4648, section 4][base64].
[[!RFC4648]]

[base64]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4

The <dfn>SHA-256</dfn>, <dfn>SHA-384</dfn>, and <dfn>SHA-512</dfn> are part
of the <dfn>SHA-2</dfn> set of cryptographic hash functions defined by the
NIST in ["FIPS PUB 180-4: Secure Hash Standard (SHS)"][shs].

### Grammatical Concepts

The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation used in this document is
specified in RFC5234. [[!ABNF]]

The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
[Appendix B.1][abnf-b1] of [[!ABNF]]: <code><dfn>WSP</dfn></code> (white space)
and <code><dfn>VCHAR</dfn></code> (printing characters).

</section>

<section>
## Framework

The integrity verification mechanism specified here boils down to the
process of generating a sufficiently strong cryptographic digest for a
resource, and transmitting that digest to a user agent so that it may be
used when fetching the resource.

<section>
### Integrity metadata

To verify the integrity of a resource, a user agent requires <dfn>integrity
metadata</dfn>, which consists of the following pieces of information:

* cryptographic hash function ("alg")
* [digest][] ("val")
* options ("opt")

The hash function and digest MUST be provided in order to validate a
resource's integrity.

<div class="note">
At the moment, no options are defined. However, future versions of
the spec may define options, such as MIME types [[!MIMETYPE]].
</div>

This metadata MUST be encoded in the same format as the `hash-source`
in [section 4.2 of the Content Security Policy Level 2 specification][csp2-section42].

For example, given a script resource containing only the string \"alert(\'Hello, world.\');\",
an author might choose [SHA-256][sha2] as a hash function.
`qznLcsROx4GACP2dm0UCKCzCG+HiZ1guq6ZZDob/Tng=` is the base64-encoded
digest that results. This can be encoded as follows:

    sha256-qznLcsROx4GACP2dm0UCKCzCG+HiZ1guq6ZZDob/Tng=
{:.example}

<div class="note">
Digests may be generated using any number of utilities. [OpenSSL][], for
example, is quite commonly available. The example in this section is the
result of the following command line:

    echo -n "alert('Hello, world.');" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64 -A

[csp2-section42]: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#source-list-syntax
[openssl]: http://www.openssl.org/
</div>

[sha2]: #dfn-sha-2
[digest]: #dfn-digest
[integrity metadata]: #dfn-integrity-metadata
</section><!-- /Framework::Required metadata -->

<section>
### Cryptographic hash functions

Conformant user agents MUST support the [SHA-256][sha2], [SHA-384][sha2]
and [SHA-512][sha2] cryptographic hash functions for use as part of a
resource's [integrity metadata][], and MAY support additional hash functions.

<section>
#### Agility

Multiple sets of [integrity metadata][] may be associated with a single
resource in order to provide agility in the face of future discoveries.
For example, the "Hello, world." resource described above may be described
by either of the following hash expressions:

    sha256-+MO/YqmqPm/BYZwlDkir51GTc9Pt9BvmLrXcRRma8u8=
    sha512-rQw3wx1psxXzqB8TyM3nAQlK2RcluhsNwxmcqXE2YbgoDW735o8TPmIR4uWpoxUERddvFwjgRSGw7gNPCwuvJg==
{:.example}

Authors may choose to specify both, for example:

    <script src="hello_world.js"
       integrity="sha256-+MO/YqmqPm/BYZwlDkir51GTc9Pt9BvmLrXcRRma8u8=
                  sha512-rQw3wx1psxXzqB8TyM3nAQlK2RcluhsNwxmcqXE2YbgoDW735o8TPmIR4uWpoxUERddvFwjgRSGw7gNPCwuvJg=="
       crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

In this case, the user agent will choose the strongest hash function in the
list, and use that metadata to validate the resource (as described below in
the "[parse metadata][parse]" and "[get the strongest metadata from
set][get-the-strongest]" algorithms).

User agents MAY deprecate support (by blocking loads) for integrity validation using 
hash functions deemed insecure. Web application authors SHOULD update integrity 
metadata to remove use of insecure hash functions.

To allow authors to switch to stronger hash functions without being held back by older
user agents, validation using unsupported hash functions acts like no integrity value 
was provided (see the "[Does resource match metadataList][match]" algorithm below). 
Authors  are encouraged to use strong hash functions, and to begin migrating to 
stronger hash functions as they become available.
</section><!-- /Framework::Cryptographic hash functions::Agility -->

<section>
#### Priority

User agents MUST provide a mechanism of determining the relative priority of two
hash functions and return the empty string if the priority is equal. That is, if
a user agent implemented a function like <dfn>getPrioritizedHashFunction(a,
b)</dfn> it would return the hash function the user agent considers the most
collision-resistant.  For example, `getPrioritizedHashFunction('sha256',
'sha512')` would return `'sha512'` and `getPrioritizedHashFunction('sha256',
'sha256')` would return the empty string.

### Resource verification algorithms

<section>
#### Apply <var>algorithm</var> to <var>resource</var>

1.  Let <var>result</var> be the result of [applying <var>algorithm</var>][apply-algorithm]
    to the [representation data][representationdata] without any content-codings
    applied, except when the user agent intends to consume the content with
    content-encodings applied. In the latter case, let <var>result</var> be
    the result of applying <var>algorithm</var> to the [representation data][representationdata].
2.  Let <var>encodedResult</var> be result of base64-encoding
    <var>result</var>.
3.  Return <var>encodedResult</var>.

[apply-algorithm]: #apply-algorithm-to-resource
</section><!-- Algorithms::apply -->
<section>
#### Is <var>resource</var> eligible for integrity validation
[eligible]: #is-resource-eligible-for-integrity-validation

In order to mitigate an attacker's ability to read data cross-origin by
brute-forcing values via integrity checks, resources are only eligible for such
checks if they are same-origin or are the result of explicit access granted to
the loading origin via CORS. [[!CORS]]

As noted in [RFC6454, section 4][uri-origin], some user agents use
globally unique identifiers for each file URI. This means that
resources accessed over a `file` scheme URL are unlikely to be
eligible for integrity checks.
{:.note}

One should note that being a [secure document][] (e.g. a document delivered
over HTTPS) is not necessary for the use of integrity validation. Because
resource integrity is only an application level security tool, and it does not
change the security state of the user agent, a [secure document] is
unnecessary. However, if integrity is used in other than a [secure document][] (e.g.
a document delivered over HTTP), authors should be aware that the integrity
provides <em>no security guarantees at all</em>. For this reason, authors should
only deliver integrity metadata on a [potentially secure origin][].  See
[Non-secure contexts remain non-secure][] for more discussion.

{:.note}

[uri-origin]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-4
[Non-secure contexts remain non-secure]: #non-secure-contexts-remain-non-secure-1


Certain HTTP headers can also change the way the resource behaves in
ways which integrity checking cannot account for. If the resource
contains these headers, it is ineligible for integrity validation:

*   `Authorization` or `WWW-Authenticate` hide resources behind a login;
    such non-public resources are excluded from integrity checks.
*   `Refresh` can cause IFrame contents to transparently redirect to an
    unintended target, bypassing the integrity check.

The following algorithm details these restrictions:

1.  Let <var>request</var> be the request that fetched
    <var>resource</var>.
2.  If <var>resource</var> contains any of the following HTTP headers,
    return `false`:
    * `Authorization`
    * `WWW-Authenticate`
    * `Refresh`
3.  If the [mode][fetch-mode] of <var>request</var> is `CORS`,
    return `true`.
4.  If the [origin][fetch-origin] of <var>request</var> is
    <var>resource</var>'s origin, return `true`.
5.  Return `false`.

Step 3 returns `true` if the resource was a CORS-enabled request. If the
resource failed the CORS checks, it won't be available to us for integrity
checking because it won't have loaded successfully.

</section><!-- Algorithms::eligible -->
<section>
#### Parse <var>metadata</var>.

This algorithm accepts a string, and returns either `no metadata`, or a set of
valid hash expressions whose hash functions are understood by
the user agent.

1.  If <var>metadata</var> is the empty string, return `no metadata`.
2.  Let <var>result</var> be the empty set.
3.  For each <var>token</var> returned by [splitting <var>metadata</var> on
    spaces][split-on-spaces]:
    1.  If <var>token</var> is not a valid metadata, skip the remaining
        steps, and proceed to the next token.
    2.  Let <var>algorithm</var> be the <var>alg</var> component of
        <var>token</var>.
    3.  If <var>algorithm</var> is a hash function recognized by the user
        agent, add <var>token</var> to <var>result</var>.
4.  Return `no metadata` if <var>result</var> is empty, otherwise return
    <var>result</var>.

[split-on-spaces]: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#split-a-string-on-spaces
</section><!-- Algorithms::parse -->
<section>
#### Get the strongest metadata from <var>set</var>.

1.  Let <var>result</var> be the empty set and <var>strongest</var> be the empty
    string.
2.  For each <var>item</var> in <var>set</var>:
    1.  If <var>result</var> is the empty set, add <var>item</var> to
        <var>result</var> and set <var>strongest</var> to <var>item</var>, skip
        to the next <var>item</var>.
    2.  Let <var>currentAlgorithm</var> be the <var>alg</var> component of
        <var>strongest</var>.
    3.  Let <var>newAlgorithm</var> be the <var>alg</var> component of
        <var>item</var>.
    4.  If the result of [`getPrioritizedHashFunction(currentAlgorithm, newAlgorithm)`][getPrioritizedHashFunction]
        is the empty string, add <var>item</var> to <var>result</var>. If the
        result is <var>newAlgorithm</var>, set <var>strongest</var> to
        <var>item</var>, set <var>result</var> to the empty set, and add
        <var>item</var> to <var>result</var>.
3.  Return <var>result</var>.

[getPrioritizedHashFunction]: #dfn-getprioritizedhashfunction-a-b
</section><!-- /Algorithms::get the strongest metadata -->
<section>
#### Does <var>resource</var> match <var>metadataList</var>?

1.  If <var>resource</var>'s URL's scheme is `about`, return `true`.
2.  Let <var>parsedMetadata</var> be the result of
    [parsing <var>metadataList</var>][parse].
3.  If <var>parsedMetadata</var> is `no metadata`, return `true`.
4.  If [<var>resource</var> is not eligible for integrity
    validation][eligible], return `false`.
5.  Let <var>metadata</var> be the result of [getting the strongest
    metadata from <var>parsedMetadata</var>][get-the-strongest].
6.  For each <var>item</var> in <var>metadata</var>:
    1.  Let <var>algorithm</var> be the <var>alg</var> component of
        <var>metadata</var>.
    2.  Let <var>expectedValue</var> be the <var>val</var> component of
        <var>metadata</var>.
    3.  Let <var>actualValue</var> be the result of [applying
        <var>algorithm</var> to <var>resource</var>][apply-algorithm].
    4.  If <var>actualValue</var> is a case-sensitive match for
        <var>expectedValue</var>, return `true`.
7.  Return `false`.

This algorithm allows the user agent to accept multiple, valid strong hash
functions. For example, a developer might write a `script` element such as:

    <script src="https://example.com/example-framework.js"
            integrity="sha256-C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh/E1uhG5Twh+Y5qFQmYg=
                       sha256-qznLcsROx4GACP2dm0UCKCzCG+HiZ1guq6ZZDob/Tng="
            crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

which would allow the user agent to accept two different content payloads, one
of which matches the first SHA256 hash value and the other matches the second
SHA256 hash value.

{:.example}

User agents may allow users to modify the result of this algorithm via user
preferences, bookmarklets, third-party additions to the user agent, and other
such mechanisms. For example, redirects generated by an extension like
[HTTPSEverywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) could load and execute
correctly, even if the HTTPS version of a resource differs from the HTTP version.

<section>
### Modifications to Fetch

The Fetch specification should contain the following modifications in order
to enable the rest of this specification's work [[!FETCH]]:

1.  The following text should be added to [section 2.1.4][fetch-requests]: "A
    [request][fetch-request] has an associated [integrity metadata][].
    Unless stated otherwise, a request's integrity metadata is the empty
    string."

2.  The following text should be added to [section 2.1.5][fetch-responses]: "A
    [response][fetch-response] has an associated integrity state, which
    is one of `indeterminate`, `pending`, `corrupt`, and `intact`. Unless
    stated otherwise, it is `indeterminate`.

3.  Perform the following steps before executing both the "[basic fetch][]" and
    "[CORS fetch with preflight][]" algorithms:

    1.  If <var>request</var>'s integrity metadata is the empty string, set
        <var>response</var>'s integrity state to `indeterminate`. Otherwise:

        1.  Set <var>response</var>'s integrity state to `pending`.
        2.  Include a `Cache-Control` header whose value is "no-transform".

4.  Add the following step before step #1 of the handling of 401 status
    codes in the [HTTP fetch][] algorithm:

    1.  If <var>request</var>'s integrity state is `pending`, set
        <var>response</var>'s integrity state to `corrupt` and return
        <var>response</var>.

5.  Before firing the [process request end-of-file][] event for any
    <var>request</var>:

    1.  If the <var>request</var>'s integrity metadata is the empty string, set
        the <var>response</var>'s integrity state to `indeterminate` and
        skip directly to firing the event.

    2.  If <var>response</var> [matches][match] the request's integrity
        metadata, set the <var>response</var>'s integrity state to `intact`
        and skip directly to firing the event.

    3.  Set the <var>response</var>'s integrity state to `corrupt`
        and skip directly to firing the event.

### Verification of HTML document subresources

A variety of HTML elements result in requests for resources that are to be
embedded into the document, or executed in its context. To support integrity
metadata for some of these elements, a new `integrity` attribute is added to
the list of content attributes for the `link` and `script` elements.

A corresponding `integrity` IDL attribute which [reflects][reflect] the
value each element's `integrity` content attribute is added to the
`HTMLLinkElement` and `HTMLScriptElement` interfaces.

A future revision of this specification is likely to include integrity support
for all possible subresources, i.e., `a`, `audio`, `embed`, `iframe`, `img`,
`link`, `object`, `script`, `source`, `track`, and `video` elements.
{:.note}

</section>

<section>
#### The `integrity` attribute

The `integrity` attribute represents [integrity metadata][] for an element.
The value of the attribute MUST be either the empty string, or at least one
valid metadata as described by the following ABNF grammar:

    integrity-metadata = *WSP hash-with-options *( 1*WSP hash-with-options ) *WSP / *WSP
    hash-with-options  = hash-expression *("?" option-expression)
    option-expression  = *VCHAR
    hash-algo          = <hash-algo production from [Content Security Policy Level 2, section 4.2]>
    base64-value       = <base64-value production from [Content Security Policy Level 2, section 4.2]>
    hash-expression    = hash-algo "-" base64-value

The `integrity` IDL attribute must [reflect][] the `integrity` content attribute.

`option-expression`s are associated on a per `hash-expression` basis and are
applied only to the `hash-expression` that immediately precedes it.

In order for user agents to remain fully forwards compatible with future
options, the user agent MUST ignore all unrecognized  `option-expression`s

Note that while the `option-expression` has been reserved in the syntax, no
options have been defined. It is likely that a future version of the spec will
define a more specific syntax for options, so it is defined here as broadly
as possible.

#### Handling integrity violations

The user agent MUST refuse to render or execute resources that fail an
integrity check, <em>and</em> MUST return an error.

On a failed integrity check, an <code>error</code> event is thrown. Developers
wishing to provide a canonical fallback resource (e.g. a resource not served
from a CDN, perhaps from a secondary, trusted, but slower source) can catch this
<code>error</code> event and provide an appropriate handler to replace the
failed resource with a different one.

##### Elements

<section>
###### The `link` element for stylesheets

Whenever a user agent attempts to [obtain a resource][] pointed to by a
`link` element that has a `rel` attribute with the value of `stylesheet`,
insert the following step between steps 1 and 2:

1.  Set the [integrity metadata][] of the request to the value
    of the element's `integrity` attribute.

Additionally, in the paragraph specifying when to fire a `load` event, add
"response with a `corrupt` integrity state" to the list of load failure
reasons which are considered network errors.

###### The `script` element

Replace step 14.1 of HTML5's ["prepare a script" algorithm][prepare] with:

1.  Let <var>src</var> be the value of the element's `src` attribute and
    the request's associated [integrity metadata][] be the value of the element's
    `integrity` attribute.

Insert the following step after step 14.5 of HTML5's
["prepare a script" algorithm][prepare]:

1.  Once the [fetching algorithm][] has completed, if the response's
    integrity state is `corrupt`, [queue a task][] to
    [fire a simple event][] named `error` at the element, and abort these
    steps.
{:start="6"}

## Proxies

Optimizing proxies and other intermediate servers which modify the
content of fetched resources MUST ensure that the digest associated
with those resources stays in sync with the new content. One option
is to ensure that the [integrity metadata][] associated with
resources is updated along with the resource itself. Another
would be simply to deliver only the canonical version of resources
for which a page author has requested integrity verification. To
support this latter option, user agents MUST send a
[`Cache-Control`][cachecontrol] header with a value of
[`no-transform`][notransform] when requesting a resource with
associated integrity metadata (see item 3 in the "[Modifications to
Fetch][]" section).

## Security Considerations

<section>
### Non-secure contexts remain non-secure

[Integrity metadata][] delivered to a context that is not a [secure context],
such as an only protects an origin against a compromise of the
server where an external resources is hosted. Network attackers can alter the
digest in-flight (or remove it entirely, or do absolutely anything else to the
document), just as they could alter the resource the hash is meant to validate.
Thus, authors SHOULD deliver integrity metadata only to a [secure
document][]. See also [securing the web][].

<section>
### Hash collision attacks

Digests are only as strong as the hash function used to generate them. User
agents SHOULD refuse to support known-weak hashing functions like MD5 or SHA-1,
and SHOULD restrict supported hashing functions to those known to be
collision-resistant. At the time of writing, SHA-256 is a good baseline.
Moreover, user agents SHOULD re-evaluate their supported hash functions
on a regular basis, and deprecate support for those functions shown to be
insecure.
</section><!-- /Security::Hash collision -->

<section>
### Cross-origin data leakage

Attackers can determine whether some cross-origin resource has certain
content by attempting to load it with a known digest, and watching for
load failures. If the load fails, the attacker can surmise that the
resource didn't match the hash, and thereby gain some insight into its
contents. This might reveal, for example, whether or not a user is
logged into a particular service.

Moreover, attackers can brute-force specific values in an otherwise
static resource: consider a JSON response that looks like this:

    {'status': 'authenticated', 'username': 'Stephan Falken'}
{:.example}

An attacker can precompute hashes for the response with a variety of
common usernames, and specify those hashes while repeatedly attempting
to load the document.

User agents SHOULD mitigate the risk by refusing to fire `error` events
on elements which loaded non-CORS cross-origin resources, but
some side-channels will likely be difficult to avoid.
