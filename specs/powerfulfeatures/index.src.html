  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  As the Web platform is extended to enable more useful and powerful
  applications, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the features
  which enable those applications are enabled only in contexts which meet a minimum
  security bar. This document outlines threat models for feature abuse on the Web
  and outline normative requirements which should be incorporated into documents
  specifying new features.

  The most obvious of the requirements discussed here is that application code
  with access to sensitive or private data be delivered over authenticated and
  confidential channels that guarantee data integrity. Delivering code securely
  cannot ensure that an application will always meet a user's security and
  privacy requirments, but it is a necessary precondition.

  <h2 id="threat-models-risks">
      Threat models and risks
  </h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <h3 id="threat-models">Threat Models</h3>

  Granting permissions to unauthenticated origins is, in the presence of a
  network attacker, equivalent to granting the permissions to any origin. The
  state of the Internet is such that we must indeed assume that a network
  attacker is present. Generally, network attackers fall into 2 classes:
  passive and active.

  <h4 id="threat-passive">Passive Network Attacker</h4>

  A "Passive Network Attacker" is a party who is able to observe traffic
  flows but who lacks the ability or chooses not to modify traffic at
  the layers which this specification is concerned with.

  Surveillance of networks in this manner "subverts the intent of communicating
  parties without the agreement of these parties" and one "cannot defend against
  the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring by other actors no matter
  how benevolent some might consider them to be." [[RFC7258]] Therefore, the
  algorithms defined in this document require mechansims that provide for the
  privacy of data at the application layer, not simply integrity.

  <h4 id="threat-active">Active Network Attacker</h4>

  An "Active Network Attacker" has all the capabilities of a "Passive Network
  Attacker" and is additionally able to modify, block or replay any data
  transiting the network.  These capabilities are available to potential
  adversaries at many levels of capability, from compromised devices offering
  or simply participating in public wireless networks, to Internet Service
  Providers indirectly introducing security and privacy vulnerabilities while
  manipulating traffic for financial gain ([[VERIZON]] and [[COMCAST]] are
  recent examples), to parties with direct intent to compromise security or
  privacy who are able to target individual users, organizations or even
  entire populations.

  <h3 id="threat-risks">Risks associated with insecure contexts</h3>

  Certain web platform features that have a distinct impact on a user's
  security or privacy should be available for use only in <a>secure
  contexts</a> in order to defend against the threats above. Features
  available in insecure contexts risk exposing these capabilities to
  network attackers:

  <ol>
    <li>
      The ability to read and modify sensitive data (personally-identifying
      information, credentials, payment instruments, and so on).
      [[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT]] is an example of an API that handles sensitive
      data.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to read and modify input from sensors on a user's device
      (camera, microphone, and GPS being particularly noteworthy, but
      certainly including less obviously dangerous sensors like the
      accelerometer). [[GEOLOCATION-API]] and [[MEDIACAPTURE-STREAMS]] are
      historical examples of features that use sensor input.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to access information about other devices a user
      has access to. [[DISCOVERY]] and [[BLUETOOTH]] are good examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to track users using temporary or persistent identifiers,
      including identifiers which reset themselves after some period of time
      (e.g. {{sessionStorage}}), identifiers the user can manually reset
      (e.g. [[ENCRYPTED-MEDIA]], Cookies [[RFC6265]], and [[IndexedDB]]),
      as well as identifying hardware features the user can't easily reset.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to introduce some state for an origin which persists across
      browsing sessions. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]] is a great example.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to manipulate a user agent's native UI in some way which
      removes, obscures, or manipulates details relevant to a user's
      understanding of her context. [[FULLSCREEN]], for instance.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to introduce some functionality for which user permission will
      be required.
    </li>
  </ol>

  This list is non-exhaustive, but should give you a feel for the types of
  risks we should consider when writing or implementing specifications.

  Note: While restricting a feature itself to <a>secure contexts</a> is
  critical, we ought not forget that facilities that carry such information
  (such as new network access mechanisms, or other generic functions with access
  to network data) are equally sensitive.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="restrictions">Restricting Features</h2>

  <h3 id="new">New Features</h3>

  When writing a specification for new features, we recommend that authors
  and editors guard sensitive APIs with checks against
  [[#settings-secure]]. For example, something like the following
  would be a good approach:

  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the <a>incumbent settings object</a> is not a <a>secure
        context</a>, then [<i>insert something appropriate here: perhaps you
        could reject a Promise with a <code>SecurityError</code>, call an error
        callback, deny a permission request, etc.</i>].
      </li>
    </ol>

    Note: If you choose to copy/paste the above text for your spec, do remember
    to put an action appropriate for your use case in place of the placeholder
    text.
  </div>

  <h3 id="legacy">Legacy Features</h3>

  The list above clearly includes some existing functionality that is currently
  available to the web over insecure channels. We recommend that such legacy
  functionality begin requiring a <a>secure context</a> as quickly as is
  reasonably possible.

  <ol>
    <li>
      If such a feature is not widely implemented, we recommend that the
      specification be immediately
      <a lt="modify a specification">modified</a> to include a restriction
      to <a>secure contexts</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If such a feature is widely implemented, but not yet in wide use, we
      recommend that it be quickly restricted to <a>secure contexts</a> by
      adding a check as described in [[#new]] to existing implementations, and
      <a lt="modify a specification">modifying the specification</a>
      accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
      If such a feature is in wide use, we recommend that the existing
      functionality be deprecated; the specification should be
      <a lt="modify a specification">modified</a> to note that it does not
      conform to the restrictions outlined in this document, and a plan should
      be developed to both offer a conformant version of the feature and to
      migrate existing users into that new version.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4 id="legacy-example">Example: Geolocation</h4>

  The [[GEOLOCATION-API]] is a good concrete example of such an feature; it is
  widely implemented and used on a large number of insecure sites. A reasonable
  path forward might look like this:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <a lt="modify a specification">Modify</a> the specification to include
      checks against [[#settings-secure] before executing the algorithms for
      {{getCurrentPosition()}} and {{watchPosition()}}.

      If [[#settings-secure]] returns <code>Not Secure</code>, then
      the algorithms should be aborted, and the <var>errorCallback</var> invoked
      with a <code>code</code> of <code>PERMISSION_DENIED</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents should announce clear intentions to disable the API for
      insecure contexts on a specific date, and warn developers accordingly
      (via console messages, for example).
    </li>
    <li>
      Leading up to the flag day, user agents should announce a deprecation
      schedule to ensure both that site authors recognize the need to modify
      their code before it simply stops working altogether, and to protect
      users in the meantime. Such a plan might include:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Disallowing persistent permission grants to insecure origins
        </li>
        <li>
          Coarsening the accuracy of the API for insecure origins (perhaps
          consistently returning city-level data rather than high-accuracy
          data)
        </li>
        <li>
          UI modifications to inform users and site authors of the risk
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

  <section>
    <h3 id="settings-secure">
      Is <var>settings object</var> a secure context?
    </h3>

    Given a <a>settings object</a> <var>settings</var>, this algorithm returns
    <code>Secure</code> if the object represents a <a>secure
    context</a>, and <code>Not Secure</code> otherwise.

    <ol>
      <li>
        If <var>settings</var>' <a>TLS state</a> is <strong>not</strong>
        <code>authenticated</code>:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Let <var>origin</var> be <var>settings</var>' <a>origin</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If <var>origin</var> is a <a>globally unique identifier</a>, set
            <var>origin</var> to the <a lt="origin of a url">origin</a>
            of <var>settings</var>'s <a>API base URL</a>.

            Note: This is future-proofing against a world where sandboxing
            {{Worker}} is a thing.

            ISSUE: "<a>API base URL</a>" isn't correct. We should use whatever
            gets produced as a result of
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27146">bug

          </li>
        </ol>

        ISSUE: <a>TLS State</a> is poorly defined. For example, we should ensure
        that sandboxed documents retain the <a>TLS State</a>
        associated with their transport mechanism. See
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27190">bug

        Note: If <var>settings</var> maps to a {{Document}} (either directly,
        or as the <a>responsible document</a> of a {{Worker}}), we'll walk all
        the way up the document's ancestor chain to verify that the whole chain
        is secure.

  <section>
    <h3 id="is-origin-trustworthy">
      Is <var>origin</var> potentially trustworthy?
    </h3>

    Certain origins are always potentially trustworthy. In particular, UAs
    MUST treat <code>file</code> URLs and URLs with hostnames names equivalent
    to "localhost" as potentially trustworthy. In principle the UA could treat
    local files and local web servers as untrustworthy. However, <em>given the
    information that is available to the UA at runtime</em>, the resources
    appear to have been transported securely. Additionally, treating such
    resources as potentially trustworthy is convenient for developers building
    an application before deploying it to the public.

    A user agent MAY choose to extend this trust to other, vendor-specific URL
    schemes like <code>app:</code> or <code>chrome-extension:</code>.

    Given an <a>origin</a> <var>origin</var>, the following algorithm returns
    <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code> or <code>Not Trustworthy</code> as
    appropriate.

    <ol>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var> is a <a>potentially secure origin</a>,
        return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

        Note: The origin of <code>blob:</code> and <code>filesystem:</code> URLs
        is the origin of the context in which they were created. Therefore,
        blobs created in an potentially secure origin will themselves be
        potentially secure. The origin of <code>data:</code> and
        <code>javascript:</code> URLs is an opaque identifier, which will not
        be considered potentially secure.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>host</code> component is or falls within
        <code>localhost.</code> [[!RFC6761]], return <code>Potentially
        Trustworthy</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>host</code> component matches one of
        the CIDR notations <code>127.0.0.0/8</code> or <code>::1/128</code>
        [[!RFC4632]], return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>scheme</code> component is
        <code>file</code>, return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>scheme</code> component is one which
        the user agent considers to be authenticated, return
        <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

        Note: See [[#packaged-applications]] for detail here.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var> has been configured as a trustworthy origin,
        return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

        Note: See [[#development-environments]] for detail here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return <code>Not Trusted</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="implementation-considerations">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="packaged-applications">Packaged Applications</h3>

  User agents that support packaged applications MAY whitelist specific URL
  schemes whose contents are authenticated by the user agent. For example,
  FirefoxOS application resources are referred to by a URL whose
  <code>scheme</code> component is <code>app:</code>. Likewise, Chrome's
  extensions and apps live on <code>chrome-extension:</code> schemes. These
  could reasonably be considered trusted origins.

  <h3 id="development-environments">Development Environments</h3>

  In order to support developers who run staging servers on non-loopback hosts,
  user agents MAY allow users to configure specific sets of origins as
  trustworthy, even though [[#is-origin-trustworthy]] would normally return
  <code>Not Trusted</code>.
