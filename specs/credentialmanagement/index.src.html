  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Signing into websites is more difficult than it should be. The user agent is
  in a unique position to improve the experience in a number of ways, and most
  modern user agents have recognized this by providing some measure of
  credential management natively in the browser. Users can save usernames and
  passwords for websites, and those <a>credentials</a> are autofilled into
  sign-in forms with varying degrees of success.

  The <code><a element-attr>autocomplete</a></code> attribute offers a
  declarative mechanism by which websites can work with user agents to improve
  the latter's ability to detect and fill sign-in forms by marking specific
  fields as "username" or "password", and user agents implement a wide variety
  of detection heuristics to work with websites which haven't taken the time to
  provide this detail in markup.

  While this combination of heuristic and declarative detection works relatively
  well, the status quo leaves some large gaps where detection is problematic.
  Sites with uncommon sign-in mechanisms (submitting credentials via
  {{XMLHttpRequest}} [[XMLHTTPREQUEST]], for instance) are difficult to reliably
  detect, as is the increasingly common case in which users wish to authenticate
  themselves using a <a>federated identity provider</a>. Allowing websites to
  more directly interact with the user agent's credential manager would allow
  the credential manager to be more accurate on the one hand, and to assist
  users with federated sign-in on the other.

  These use cases are explored in more detail in [[#use-cases]] and in
  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/usecases/credentialmanagement/">
  Credential Management: Use Cases and Requirements</a>; this specification
  attempts to address many of the requirements that document outlines by
  defining a Credential Manager API which a website can use to request
  <a>credentials</a> for a user, and to ask the user agent to persist
  credentials when a user signs in successfully.

  Note: The API defined here is intentionally small and simple: it does not
  intend to provide authentication in and of itself, but is limited to providing
  an interface to the existing credential managers implemented by existing user
  agents. That functionality is valuable <em>right now</em>, without significant
  effort on the part of either vendors or authors. There's certainly quite a bit
  more which could be done, of course. See [[#future-work]] for some thoughts
  we've punted for now, but which could be explored in future iterations of this
  API.

  <section>
    <h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>

    Modern user agents generally offer users the capability to save passwords
    when signing into a website, and likewise offer the capability to fill those
    passwords into sign-in forms fully- or semi-automatically when users return
    to a website. From the perspective of a website, this behavior is completely
    invisible: the website doesn't know that passwords have been stored, and it
    isn't notified that passwords have been filled. This is both good and bad.
    On the one hand, a user agent's password manager works regardless of whether
    or not a site cooperates, which is excellent for users. On the other, the
    password managers' behaviors are a fragile and proprietary hodgepodge of
    heuristics meant to detect and fill sign-in forms, password change forms,
    etc.

    A few problems with the status quo stand out as being particularly
    problematic:

    <ul>
      <li>
        User agents have an incredibly difficult time helping users with
        federated identity providers. While detecting a username/password
        form submission is fairly straightforward, detecting sign-in via a
        third-party is quite difficult to reliably do well. It would be nice
        if a website could help the user agent understand the intent behind the
        redirects associated with a typical federated sign-in action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Likewise, user agents struggle to detect more esoteric sign-in
        mechanisms than simple username/password forms. Authors increasingly
        asynchronously sign users in via {{XMLHttpRequest}} or similar
        mechanisms in order to improve the experience and take more control over
        the presentation. This is good for users, but tough for user agents to
        integrate into their password managers. It would be nice if a website
        could help the user agent make sense of the sign-in mechanism they
        choose to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        While signing into a website with a username and password is fairly well
        supported, creating a new account on a website is more or less left up
        to the user. The user agent's knowledge of a user's browsing history,
        access to the <a>credential store</a>, and general mediation of a user's
        activity means that it is in a very good position indeed to help users
        sign up for new sites.

        Note: This is especially true for sites which support federated identity
        providers, as those often support not just one or two, but many. Rather
        than presenting a user with a dozen icons from which to choose a
        familiar-looking provider, the site can ask the user agent to display
        only those providers the user actually uses. See
        [[#user-mediated-selection]] for discussion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, changing passwords is less well-suppported than it could be if
        the website explicitly informed the user agent that credentials had
        changed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="introduction-examples">Examples</h3>

    <h4 id="examples-password-signin">Password-based Sign-in</h4>

    A website that supports only username/password pairs can request
    credentials, and use them in existing sign-in forms:

    <div class="example">
      <pre>
        navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="get()">get</a>({
          "<a idl>types</a>": [ "password" ]
        }).then(
            function(credential) {
              if (!credential) {
                // The user either doesn't have credentials for this site, or
                // refused to share them. Insert some code here to show a basic
                // login form (or, ideally, do nothing, since this API should
                // really be progressive enhancement on top of an existing form).
                return;
              }
              if (credential.type == "password") {
                credential.<a method lt="send()">send</a>("https://example.com/loginEndpoint")
                  .then(function (response) {
                    // Notify the user that signin succeeded! Do amazing, signed-in things!
                  });
              } else {
                // See <a href="#examples-federated-signin">the Federated Sign-in example</a>
              }
            });
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-federated-signin">Federated Sign-in</h4>

    A website that supports <a>federated identity providers</a> can request
    credentials, and use them to kick off the sign-in flow for the user's
    chosen provider:

    <div class="example">
      <pre>
        navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="get()">get</a>({
          "<a idl>types</a>": [ "federated" ],
          "<a idl>options</a>": {
              "<a idl>providers</a>": [ "https://federation.com" ]
          }
        }).then(
            function(credential) {
              if (!credential)
                return;

              if (credential.type == "FederatedCredential") {
                switch (credential.<a idl for="FederatedCredential">provider</a>) {
                case "https://www.facebook.com/":
                  // Use Facebook's SDK, a la https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/#logindialog
                  FB.login(function (response) {
                    if (response.status === "authorized") {
                      // Can now use FB.api() calls
                    } else {
                      // Explain to the user that we would really like them to click "Log me in"
                    }
                  });
                  break;

                case "https://accounts.google.com/":
                  // Ditto
                  break;

                // ...
                }
              } else {
                credential.<a method lt="send()">send</a>("https://example.com/loginEndpoint")
                  .then(function (response) { ... })
                  .catch(function (response) { ... });
              }
            });
      </pre>

      Note: This API does not go out to the identity provider to grab a token,
      or authenticate the user in any way. It provides a hint to the website as
      to which identity provider the user prefers to use, and little more. See
      [[#future-work]] for directions future versions of this API could take.
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-post-signin">Post-sign-in Confirmation</h4>

    To ensure that credentials are persisted correctly, it may be useful for a
    website to tell the credential manager that sign-in succeeded.

    <div class="example">
      If a user is signed in by calling {{send()}} on a {{PasswordCredential}}
      object, then we can check the response to determine whether the user
      was signed in successfully, and notify the user agent accordingly:

      <pre>
        var credential = new <a idl>PasswordCredential</a>({
          "<a idl for="CredentialData">id</a>": "JaneDoe98",
          "<a idl for="PasswordCredentialData">password</a>": "MfPeRQq5P3yVry68Q4KZMMhB"
        });
        credential.send("https://example.com/sign-in/")
          .then(function (response) {
            if (response.status == 200)
              navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="store()">store</a>(credential);
          });
      </pre>

      Note: This example assumes that the sign-in API endpoint will
      differentiate between success and failure via an HTTP response code. This
      is a reasonable model, but it would of course also be possible to parse
      the response body for a <code>success</code> property, or some other form
      of application-specific signal.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      If we're using a <a>federated identity provider</a>:

      <pre>
        if (navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>) {
          navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="store()">store</a>(
            new <a idl>FederatedCredential</a>({
              "<a idl for="CredentialData">id</a>": "username",
              "<a idl for="FederatedCredentialData">provider</a>": "https://federation.com"
            })
          );
        }
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-sign-up">Sign-Up</h4>

    The "federated sign-in" mechanism can be reused for "sign-up" with no
    modifications: if the user has a credential from a supported federated
    identity provider, it could be offered to the user via the same request
    mechanism.

    <h4 id="examples-change-password">Change Password</h4>

    The "Password Sign-In" mechanism can be reused for "password change" with no
    modifications: if the user changes her credentials, the website can notify
    the user agent that she's successfully signed in with new credentials. The
    user agent can then update the credentials it stores.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="existing-solutions">
      Haven't we done this before? What about [<em>insert technology here</em>]?
    </h3>

    <h4 id="existing-solutions-browserid">BrowserID/Persona</h4>

    BrowserID is a proposal for an API which allows websites to request an
    assertion of a user's email address ownership. [[BROWSERID]]

    The API specified here does not attempt to assert the user's identity
    directly: it only provides a more direct interface to the user agent's
    <a>credential store</a>. Assertions about identity would still rely on
    <a>federated identity provider</a>'s particular SDKs and workflows.

    BrowserID is complementary to this API, and could be tacked onto the
    {{FederatedCredential}} flow at some point in the future. For example, a
    user who chooses a {{FederatedCredential}} whose origin supports
    BrowserID could perform the authentication steps in the background by
    passing the user's email address and public key to the relevant
    <a>identity provider</a>, and adding a new property to the
    {{FederatedCredential}} given back to the website which contains the
    signed certificate asserting the user's identity.

    This document doesn't specify any of that behavior, but is designed with
    it in mind: the immediate goal is to give websites more direct access to
    the user agent's existing credential manager, as federations are completely
    unsupported at the moment. Generating assertions is an obvious next step.
    See [[#future-work]] for other thoughts on the subject.

      Broadly speaking, <strong>credential</strong> is an assertion about an
      entity which enables a trust decision. This specification defines two
      specific types of credentials which are useful for authentication:
      "password" credentials, which consist of a username/password
      pair, and "federated" credentials, which point out to a <a>federated
      identity provider</a> which is trusted to correctly assert a user's
      authentication.

      Note: These two types are, of course, not exhaustive. Future versions of
      this and other documents will likely define other types of credentials.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <dfn export>Credential Store</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A <strong>credential store</strong> is an opaque storage mechanism which
      offers a user agent the ability to save, retrieve, and modify
      {{LocallyStoredCredential}} objects; and to mark <a>origins</a> with a
      <dfn>requires user mediation</dfn> flag. The implementation is
      vendor-specific, and the interface provided is not exposed to the web.

      Note: The types of credentials defined in this document are stored locally
      in a user agent's credential store, but future versions of this and other
      documents will likely define credential types which are external to the
      user agent.

      A <strong>federated identity provider</strong> is an entity which a

  <h2 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h2>

  <h3 id="interfaces-credential-types">Credential Types</h3>

  This document defines a generic and extensible {{Credential}} interface from
  which all <a>credentials</a> will inherit, and a slightly less-generic
  {{LocallyStoredCredential}}, which defines the specific attributes shared
  by any <a>credential</a> persisted in user agent's <a>credential store</a>.

  {{PasswordCredential}} and {{FederatedCredential}} both inherit from

  <div class="example">
    Suppose <code>https://example.com/</code> only supports federated sign-in
    via <code>https://identity.example.com/</code>. It could request credentials
    via the following call:

    <pre>
      navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="get()">get</a>({

      }).then(function (credential) {
        // ...
      });
    </pre>

    If it wanted to ensure that the user agent didn't bother the user with
    questions, it could ask to suppress UI for the request (and, therefore,
    to receive {{Credential}}s if and only if the user had chosen to
    automatically sign into the origin):

    <pre>

    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="identifying-federations">Identifying providers</h4>

  Every site should use the same identifier when referring to a specific
  <a>federated identity provider</a>. For example,
  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/v2.0">Facebook Login</a>
  shouldn't be "Facebook" and "Facebook Login" and "FB" and "FBL" and
  "Facebook.com" and so on. It should have a canonical identifier which everyone
  can make use of, as consistent identification makes it possible for user
  agents to be helpful.

  For consistency, federations passed into the APIs defined in this document
  (e.g. {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions}}'s
  {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/providers}} array, or
  {{FederatedCredential}}'s {{FederatedCredential/provider}} property)
  MUST be identified by the <a>ASCII serialization</a> of the origin the
  provider uses for sign in. That is, Facebook would be represented by
  <code>https://www.facebook.com</code> and Google by
  <code>https://accounts.google.com</code>.

  The ASCII serialization of an origin does <em>not</em> include a trailing
  U+002F SOLIDUS ("<code>/</code>"), but user agents SHOULD accept them
  silently: <code>https://accounts.google.com/</code> is clearly intended to
  be the same as <code>https://accounts.google.com</code>.

<section>
  <h2 id="user-mediation">User Mediation</h2>

  Exposing credential information to the web via an API has a number of
  potential impacts on user privacy. The user agent, therefore, MUST
  involve the user in a number of cases in order to ensure that she clearly
  understands what's going on, and with whom her credentials are being shared.

  <h3 id="user-mediated-storage">Storing and Updating Credentials</h3>

  Credential information is sensitive data, and users MUST remain in control
  of that information's storage. Inadvertent credential storage could, for
  instance, unexpectedly link a user's local profile on a particular device to
  a specific online persona. To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Credential information MUST NOT be stored or updated without explicit
      user consent. For example, the user agent could display a "Save this
      password?" dialog box to the user in response to each call to
      {{store()}}.
    </li>
    <li>
      User consent MAY be requested every time a credential is stored or
      updated, <strong>or</strong> the user agent MAY request a more persistent
      grant of consent which would apply to some or all subsequent API
      operations.

      For example, a user agent may offer an option to "Always save passwords",
      or "Always save password on this site".
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents SHOULD notify users when credentials are stored. This might
      take the form of an icon in the address bar, or some similar location.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST allow users to manually remove stored credentials. This
      functionality might be implemented as a settings page, or via interaction
      with a notification as described above.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="user-mediation-requirements">Requiring User Mediation</h3>

  If a an <a>origin</a>'s <a>requires user mediation</a> flag is set to
  <code>false</code> in the user agent's <a>credential store</a>, then
  {{Credential}} objects from that origin MAY be provided to pages from that
  origin without user interaction. The user will be signed-in to that origin
  persistently, which, on the one hand, is desirable from the perspective of
  usability and convinience, but which might nevertheless surprise the user.

  If the user agent syncs the state of a {{Credential}} between devices, an
  origin could explicitly tie the devices together in a way which might surprise
  their owner.

  To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  <ol>
    <li>
      User agents MUST allow users to require user mediation for {{Credential}}
      objects. This functionality might be implemented as a global toggle that
      requires user mediation for all origins, or via more granular settings
      for specific origins (or specific credentials on specific origins).
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST NOT set an origin's <a>requires user mediation</a> slot's
      value to <code>false</code> without user consent. For example, the
      <a>credential chooser</a> described in [[#user-mediated-selection]] could
      have a checkbox which the user could toggle to mark the selected
      credential as available without mediation for the origin, or the user
      agent could have an onboarding process for its credential manager which
      asked a user for a default setting.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST notify users when credentials are provided to an
      origin. This could take the form of an icon in the address bar, or some
      similar location.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a user clears her browsing data for an origin (cookies, localStorage,
      and so on), the user agent MUST require user mediation for that origin
      by executing the algorithm defined in
      [[#require-user-mediation-for-origin]].
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="user-mediated-selection">Credential Selection</h3>

  When responding to a call to {{get()}} on an origin without credentials
  that are available without user mediation, user agents MUST ask the user for
  permission to share credential information. This SHOULD take the form of a
  <dfn local-lt="chooser">credential chooser</dfn> which presents the user
  with a list of credentials that are available for use on a site, allowing her
  to select one which should be provided to the website, or to reject the
  request entirely.

  The chooser interface SHOULD be implemented in such a way as to be
  distinguishable from UI which a website could produce. For example, the
  chooser might overlap the user agent's UI in some unspoofable way.

  The chooser interface SHOULD include an indication of the origin which is
  requesting credentials.

  The chooser interface SHOULD include all {{Credential}} objects associated
  with the origin that requested credentials. It may also synthesize
  {{Credential}} objects to support a sign-up use case, as discussed in
  [[#synthesis]].

  <em>The following image is an exceptionally non-normative mock:</em>

  <img src="./mock-chooser.png" alt="A mockup of what a chooser might look like.">

  User agents MAY internally associate information with each {{Credential}}
  object beyond the attributes specified in this document in order to enhance
  the utility of such a chooser. For example, favicons could help disambiguate
  identity providers, etc. Any additional information stored MUST not be
  exposed directly to the web.

  <h4 id="synthesis">Synthesizing Credentials</h4>

  In response to a call to {{get()}} a user agent can offer a user the ability
  to create a {{Credential}} on the fly, rather than returning an empty set.
  Since credentials suggested in the <a>credential chooser</a> are never exposed
  to the web unless the user explicitly selects them, the user agent is free
  to use any of a number of heuristics to help a user get signed-into/-up for
  a website.

  Credentials SHOULD be synthesized to populate a <a>chooser</a> based on the
  following heuristics:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Let <var>synthesized</var> be an empty list.
    </li>
    <li>
      Switch on the interface whose {{Credential/type}} property matches one of
      the items in the {{CredentialRequest}} {{CredentialRequest/types}}
      sequence, and execute the associated steps:

      <dl>
        <dt>{{FederatedCredential}}</dt>
        <dd>
          When executing the [[#gather-locallystoredcredentials]] algorithm, a

              Let <var>providers</var> be the value of <var>options</var>'
              <var>providers</var> property.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each {{PasswordCredential}} <var>credential</var> in the
              <a>credential store</a>:

              <ol>
                <li>
                  For each <var>provider</var> in <var>options</var>'
                  {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/providers}} property:

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      If [[#is-match]] returns <code>Exact Match</code> or
                      <code>Fuzzy Match</code> when executed upon
                      <var>credential</var> and <var>provider</var>:

                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          Create a new {{FederatedCredential}} object
                          <var>new</var> whose {{[[origin]]}} slot is set to
                          <var>origin</var>, {{Credential/id}} is set to
                          <var>credential</var>'s {{Credential/id}},
                          {{FederatedCredential/provider}} is set to
                          <var>provider</var>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Append <var>new</var> to <var>synthesized</var>.

    <li>
      Return <var>synthesized</var>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  User agents MAY employ additional heuristics (based, for instance, on a user's
  browsing history, crowdsourcing, etc) to further populate the <a>chooser</a>.

  <div class="example">
    Assume for a moment that <code>https://example.com/</code> is an amazing new
    website that supports a large number of federated identity providers in an
    effort to make sign-up as seamless as possible for new users. This ends up
    being a bit counterproductive, as the site needs to display a list of dozens
    of providers, hoping that users will see an icon they remember.

    A call to {{get()}} will end up with an empty list of {{Credential}} objects
    for new users, as they won't have any <code>https://example.com/</code>
    credentials. They might, however, have a {{PasswordCredential}} stored for
    the exciting social media site <code>https://federation.com/</code>, which
    they visit daily.

    In this case, based on its knowledge of the user's history and credentials,
    the user agent might choose to synthesize a {{FederatedCredential}} for
    <code>https://example.com/</code>, using the {{Credential/id}} from
    <code>https://federation.com/</code>'s {{PasswordCredential}}, and offer
    it to the user as a sign-up options in a <a>chooser</a>.

    In this way, <code>https://example.com/</code> can support dozens of
    providers as arguments to {{get()}} (via
    {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions}}'s
    {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/providers}} property), and the user
    agent can cull that list down to the federations with which the user
    regularly interacts (or which have been previously used as
    {{FederatedCredential}}s, or any of a number of other heuristics).

  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="security-cross-origin-leakage">Cross-origin Credential Leakage</h3>

  Credentials are sensitive information, and user agents need to exercise
  caution in determining when they can be safely shared with a website. The
  safest option is to restrict credential sharing to the exact origin on
  which they were saved. That is likely too restrictive for the web, however:
  consider sites which divide functionality into subdomains:
  <code>example.com</code> vs <code>admin.example.com</code>.

  As a compromise between annoying users, and securing their credentials, user
  agents:

  <ol>
    <li>
      MUST NOT share credentials between origins whose scheme components are
      not the same. That is: credentials saved on
      <code>https://example.com/</code> will never be available to
      <code>http://example.com/</code> via {{get()}}
    </li>
    <li>
      MAY use the Public Suffix List [[!PSL]] to determine the effective scope
      of a credential by comparing the <a>registerable domains</a> of the
      credential's {{[[origin]]}} with the origin in which
      {{get()}} is called. That is: credentials saved on
      <code>https://admin.example.com/</code> and
      <code>https://example.com/</code> MAY be offered to users when
      {{get()}} is called from <code>https://www.example.com/</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      MUST NOT offer credentials to an origin in response to {{get()}}
      without user mediation if the credential's origin is not an exact match
      for the calling origin. That is, {{Credential}} objects for
      <code>https://example.com</code> would not be returned directly to
      <code>https://www.example.com</code>, but could be offered to the user
      via the chooser.
    </li>
  </ol>

  {{PasswordCredential}}s further mitigate the risk of data leakage by never
  exposing the {{[[password]]}} slot directly to a page's JavaScript, but
  instead performing asynchronous submission via {{PasswordCredential/send()}},
  which verifies that the endpoint is a valid one for the credential before
  submission.

  Additionally, authors SHOULD mitigate the risk of leakage by setting a
  reasonable Content Security Policy [[!CSP2]] which restricts the origins to
  which data can be sent. In particular, authors should ensure that the
  following directives are set, explicitly or implicitly, in
  their pages' policies:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <code><a>connect-src</a></code> further restricts the origins to which
      {{PasswordCredential/send()}} may submit data (which mitigates the risk of
      redirect-based attacks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code><a>child-src</a></code> restricts the nested browsing
      contexts which may be embedded in a page, making it more difficult to
      inject a malicious {{postMessage()}} target. [[WEBMESSAGING]]
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="security-origin-confusion">Origin Confusion</h3>

  If framed pages have access to the APIs defined here, it might be possible
  to confuse a user into granting access to credentials for an origin other
  than the <a>top-level browsing context</a>, which is the only security origin
  which users can reasonably be expected to understand.

  Therefore, <a>Nested browsing contexts</a> and other environments like
  Workers [[WORKERS]] cannot receive or store {{Credential}} objects; the user
  agent MUST reject promises generated by calls to {{get()}} and
  {{store()}} with a <code>SecurityError</code> when called from a
  context which is not a <a>top-level browsing context</a>.

  See the algorithms defined in [[#request-credential]] and [[#store-credential]]
  for details.

  <h3 id="security-insecure-origins">Insecure Sites</h3>

  User agents MUST NOT expose credential information via the APIs defined here
  to environments which are not <a>privileged contexts</a>. User agents MAY
  implement autofill mechanisms which store user credentials and fill sign-in
  forms on <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> insecure origins</a>, but those
  sites cannot be trusted to interact directly with the credential manager in
  any meaningful way.

  <h3 id="security-xss">Script Injection</h3>

  If a malicious party is able to inject script into an origin, they could
  (among many other things you wouldn't like) overwrite the behavior of
  {{store()}} to steal a user's credentials as they're written into the
  <a>credential store</a>.

  Authors SHOULD mititgate the risk of such attacks by properly escaping input
  and output, and add layers of defense in depth by setting a reasonably
  strong Content Security Policy [[CSP2]] which restricts the origins from
  which script can be injected, and by using Subresource Integrity checks
  [[SRI]] to ensure that only trusted JavaScript is executed.

  <h3 id="security-autocomplete-off">
    Avoid reintroducing <code>autocomplete="off"</code>
  </h3>

  Some user agents have decided not to implement the
  <a element-attr>autocomplete</a></code> attribute in such a way as to
  prevent users from saving credentials. The APIs defined here SHOULD be
  implemented such that they don't provide an automatic way of bypassing that
  decision. Some of the requirements in [[#user-mediated-storage]] are in place
  for exactly this reason.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="privacy-timing-attacks">Timing Attacks</h3>

  If the user has no credentials for an origin, a call to {{get()}} will
  resolve very quickly indeed. A malicious website could distinguish between
  a user with no credentials and a user with credentials who chooses not to
  share them.

  This could allow a malicious website to determine if a user has credentials
  saved for particular federated identity providers by repeatedly calling
  {{get()}} with a single item in the
  {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/providers}} array. The risk is mitigated
  by the fact that a user-mediated {{get()}} is tied to a user gesture, and the
  user would, sooner or later, be prompted to provide credentials to the site,
  which would certainly raise her suspicions as to its behavior.

  <h3 id="privacy-chooser-leakage">Chooser Leakage</h3>

  If a user agent displays images supplied by a website or federation (for
  example, if a {{Credential}}'s {{LocallyStoredCredential/iconURL}} is displayed),
  requests for these images MUST NOT be directly tied to instantiating the
  chooser in order to avoid leaking chooser usage. One option would be to fetch
  the images in the background when saving or updating a {{Credential}}, and to
  cache them for the lifetime of the {{Credential}}.

  Further, these images MUST be fetched with the <code>credentials</code> mode
  set to "<code>omit</code>".

  <h3 id="locally-stored-data">Locally Stored Data</h3>

  This API offers an <a>origin</a> the ability to store data persistently along
  with a user's profile. Since most user agents treat credential data
  differently than "browsing data" (cookies, etc.) this might have the side
  effect of surprising a user who might believe that all traces of an origin
  have been wiped out when they clear their cookies.

  User agents SHOULD provide UI that makes it clear to a user that credential
  data is stored for an origin, and SHOULD make it easy for users to remove
  such data when they're no longer interested in keeping it around.

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  ISSUE(w3c/webappsec#290): Add some thoughts here about when and how the API
  should be used, especially with regard to {{suppressUI}}.

  <h3 id="implementation-extension">Extension Points</h3>

  As noted in [[#future-work]], there is known interest in extending the API
  defined here to serve use cases beyond those this document addresses. To
  that end, the API is fairly generic, with several explicit extension points.

  <div class="example">
    If we wished to add a new credential type, how would we spell it out?

    <ol>
      <li>
        Define a new <code>ExampleCredential</code> that inherits from
        {{Credential}}:

        <pre>
          interface ExampleCredential : Credential {
            // Definition goes here.
          };
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Define the options that the new credential type requires, and add them
        to the {{CredentialRequestOptions}} typedef:

        <pre>
          dictionary ExampleCredentialRequestOptions {
            // Definition goes here.
          };

          typedef (FederatedCredentialRequestOptions or ExampleCredentialRequestOptions) CredentialRequestOptions;
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add <code>ExampleCredential</code> to the switch in step 8 of
        [[#request-credential]], and define the request behavior necessary to
        grab and return the new type.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add <code>ExampleCredential</code> to the switch in step 6 of
        [[#store-credential]], and define the persistance behavior necessary to
        store the new type.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  You might also need new primitives. For instance, you might want to return
  many {{Credential}} objects rather than just one. That might be accomplished
  in a generic fashion by adding a <code>getAll()</code> method to
  {{CredentialContainer}}, and defining a <code>CredentialSet</code> object that
  contained a <code>sequence&lt;Credential&gt;</code>, and could be easily
  extended to meet some use case.

  For any such extension, we recommend getting in touch with
  <a href="mailto:public-webappsec@w3.org">public-webappsec@</a> for
  consultation and review.

  <h3 id="implementation-browser-extensions">Browser Extensions</h3>

  Ideally, user agents that implement an extension system of some sort will
  allow third-parties to hook into these API endpoints in order to improve
  the behavior of third party credential management software in the same way
  that user agents can improve their own via this imperative approach.

  This could range from a complex new API that the user agent mediates, or
  simply by allowing extensions to overwrite the {{get()}} and {{store()}}
  endpoints for their own purposes.

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The API defined here does the bare minimum to expose user agent's credential
  managers to the web, and allows the web to help those credential managers
  understand when <a>federated identity providers</a> are in use. The next
  logical step will be along the lines sketched in documents like [[WEB-LOGIN]]
  (and, to some extent, Mozilla's BrowserID [[BROWSERID]]).

  The user agent is in the unique position of being able to effectively mediate
  the relationship between users, identity providers, and websites. If the user
  agent can remove some of the risk and confusion associated with the typical
  authentication flows, users will be in a significantly better position than
  today.

  The natural way to expose this information is to extend the
  {{FederatedCredential}} interface with properties like authentication tokens,
  and to add some form of manifest format with properties that declare the
  authentication type which the provider supports.

  Baby steps.

  <div class="issue">
    Groups like the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payments IG</a>
    and the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials CG</a>
    have expressed interest in extending the API defined in this document in
    order to address use cases beyond those outlined in [[#use-cases]]. They've
    documented these use cases in detail in
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">Web Payments Use Cases 1.0</a>
    and
    <a href="http://opencreds.org/specs/source/use-cases/">Credentials CG Use Cases</a>,
    and anticipate extending the API in a separate document to solve a different
    set of problems than WebAppSec is currently chartered to deal with.  We
    should keep track of this work as it progresses and make appropriate
    references to any technical reports which may assist in understanding and
    implementing this report, as appropriate, when this document is ready to
    transition to Recommendation status.

    It's not yet clear whether the API proposed in this document allows these
    and other groups to elegantly address the problems they're interested in
    solving. We may wish to adjust portions of the API before advancing this
    document to REC in order to ensure clean extensibility into these other
    areas.
